</HEAD>
<BODY>
<P>In my previous article, <A HREF="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2011/04/01/a-recipe-for-a-yui-3-application">A
Recipe for a YUI 3 Application</A>, I showed a way to use
<CODE>Y.substitute</CODE> as a very basic template
processor. The idea took life from there, with suggestions from the
folks in the #yui IRC channel, and I made it a Widget extension that
is available on my site, called <A HREF="http://satyam.com.ar/yui/3.0.0/makenode/makenode.js">MakeNode</A>.
MakeNode is not a generic template processor and it is not meant as
one. On the other hand, it is tightly integrated with the YUI <A HREF="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/widget/">Widget</A>
foundation class, including className and event helpers and
internationalization. In this article, I will take the <A HREF="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/examples/widget/widget-extend.html">Spinner</A>
example and modify it to follow the guidelines from my previous
article and to use MakeNode. <A HREF="http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/makenode">MakeNode</A>
is available as a gallery component as well as the modified <A HREF="http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/md-spinner">Spinner</A>
component and the <A HREF="http://satyam.com.ar/yui/3.0.0/SpinnerTest.html">example</A>
that will be used in this article. 
</P>
<H2>Extending your component</H2>
<P>To load MakeNode you need to include the module in your
<CODE>YUI().use()</CODE> statement using the name
<CODE>'gallery-makenode'</CODE>or, if defining a
module via <CODE>YUI.add()</CODE>, list it in the
<CODE>requires</CODE> array. Then, to extend your
widget, you list it in the third argument to <CODE>Y.Base.create()</CODE>,
like this:</P>
<PRE>Y.Spinner = Y.Base.create(
     'Spinner',
     Y.Widget,
     [Y.MakeNode],
     {
        // instance members …
     },
     {
         // static members
     }
); </PRE><P>
You can add MakeNode along any number of suitable extensions for
Widget, such as WidgetParent, WidgetChild, WidgetStdMode, etc.
MakeNode adds two protected methods to be used by the developer,
<CODE>_makeNode</CODE> and <CODE>_locateNodes,</CODE>
and it will read from several static properties, if found.</P>
<P>All members of this extension are either protected or private
since they are meant to be used by the component developer and not by
the implementer using those components, who should not be bothered
with them. Remember to check the Show Protected option when viewing
the <A HREF="http://satyam.github.com/apiDocsGallery/MakeNode.html">API
docs</A>. 
</P>
<H2>Defining the Template</H2>
<P>The first thing you will normally do is to define the template for
your component. For the Spinner, our template will be:</P>
<PRE>_TEMPLATE: [
    '&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; title=&quot;{s input}&quot; class=&quot;{c input}&quot;&gt;',
    '&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; title=&quot;{s up}&quot; class=&quot;{c up}&quot;&gt;&lt;/button&gt;',
    '&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; title=&quot;{s down}&quot; class=&quot;{c down}&quot;&gt;&lt;/button&gt;'
].join('\n'),</PRE><P>
The default template will usually be named <CODE>_TEMPLATE</CODE>
and declared along the other static properties of the class, such as
<CODE>ATTRS</CODE>. MakeNode will use this template
if none other is explicitly provided. The template is made of plain
HTML plus a series of placeholders enclosed in curly brackets, each
made of a single character (the processing code) and followed by one
or more arguments. The placeholders and what they produce are:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><CODE>{@ attributeName}</CODE> configuration
	attribute value 
	</P>
	<LI><P><CODE>{p propertyName}</CODE> instance
	property value 
	</P>
	<LI><P><CODE>{m methodName arg1 arg2 ….}</CODE>
	return value of the given method. The processing code is followed by
	the method name and any number of arguments separated by whitespace.
		</P>
	<LI><P><CODE>{c classNameKey}</CODE> CSS className
	generated from the <CODE>_CLASS_NAMES</CODE> static
	property (see <A HREF="#_CLASS_NAMES">later</A>)</P>
	<LI><P><CODE>{s key}</CODE> string from the <CODE>strings</CODE>
	attribute, using <CODE>key</CODE> as the
	sub-attribute.</P>
	<LI><P><CODE>{? </CODE><CODE><I>condition</I></CODE><CODE>
	</CODE><CODE><I>valueIfTrue valueIfFalse</I></CODE><CODE>}</CODE>
	much like the <CODE>?: </CODE>operator of
	JavaScript, produces <CODE>valueIfTrue</CODE> if
	condition is truish, <CODE>valueIfFalse</CODE>
	otherwise.</P>
	<LI><P><CODE>{1 </CODE><CODE><I>condition
	valueIfOne valueIfMore</I></CODE><CODE>}</CODE> used
	to produce singular/plural words based on the value of condition. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><CODE>{}</CODE> any other value will be
	handled just like <CODE>Y.substitute</CODE> does. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>For example, <CODE>{@ value}</CODE> will translate
to <CODE>this.get('value')</CODE> while <CODE>{p
value}</CODE> translates to <CODE>this['value']</CODE>.
</P>
<P>When placeholders have arguments, like <CODE>{m}</CODE>,
<CODE>{?}</CODE> and <CODE>{1}</CODE>,
strings must be enclosed in double quotation marks. Numbers, Booleans
and <CODE>null</CODE> (all unquoted) will be parsed
to their proper data types. Placeholders can be nested. The <CODE>{?}</CODE>
and <CODE>{1}</CODE> placeholders will usually
contain a nested placeholder for the condition and quite possible for
their values, for example:</P>
<PRE>{p qty} {1 {p qty} &quot;unit&quot; &quot;units&quot;} </PRE><P>
If the property <CODE>qty</CODE> is 1, it will
produce <CODE>&quot;1 unit&quot;</CODE>, for 2 or
more it will return <CODE>&quot;2 units&quot;</CODE>
and so on. A more elaborate version dealing with zero would be:</P>
<PRE>{? {p qty} &quot;{p qty} {1 {p qty} &quot;unit&quot; &quot;units&quot;}&quot; &quot;none&quot;} </PRE><P>
Note that the result of processing the inner placeholders, if a
string, must be enclosed in its own set of quotes.</P>
<P>To include a double quote inside a quoted string, use <CODE>\\&quot;</CODE>,
the double backslash being required because JavaScript will interpret
a single one and discards it before it gets to MakeNode. Only double
quotes are allowed, MakeNode does not use <CODE>eval()</CODE>
so the parser is limited but safe. Anything but numbers, <CODE>null</CODE>,
Booleans and double quoted strings will be ignored.</P>
<P>The <CODE>{?}</CODE> placeholder is also handy to
use with checkboxes and radio buttons. It can be used to produce the
string <CODE>&quot;checked&quot;</CODE> depending on
the truth value of the processing instruction code that follows.
Thus, <CODE>&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; {? {m
getLength} &quot;checked&quot; &quot;&quot;}/&gt;</CODE> will produce
a marked checkbox if the <CODE>getLength</CODE>
method returns anything but zero.</P>
<P>For the <CODE>{c}</CODE> placeholder, we need to
have a <CODE>_CLASS_NAMES</CODE> property defined.</P>
<P>Further placeholders can be added to MakeNode by adding them into
the <CODE>_templateHandlers</CODE> hash.</P>
<H2><A NAME="_CLASS_NAMES"></A>The _CLASS_NAMES
property</H2>
<P>Along with the <CODE>ATTRS</CODE> and <CODE>_TEMPLATE</CODE>
static properties, we can define a <CODE>_CLASS_NAMES</CODE>
static property which points to an array of strings. Each of those
strings will be used to generate a className. Thus <CODE>_CLASS_NAMES:
['input']</CODE> will produce the className <CODE>&quot;yui3-spinner-input&quot;</CODE>.
Those classNames are stored in an instance property <CODE>this._classNames</CODE>.
The <CODE>{c input}</CODE> placeholder in the
template above will be replaced by <CODE>&quot;yui3-spinner-input&quot;</CODE>.
I call the strings listed in <CODE>_CLASS_NAMES</CODE>,
such as <CODE>'input'</CODE>, the 'className <I>keys</I>'
since they can be used as a key to refer to the actual className or
the elements containing those classNames, as we'll seen later.</P>
<P>You can use the <CODE>_CLASS_NAMES</CODE> property
to generate any number of classNames, whether you use them in the
template or not. You can still reach those extra classNames from
within <CODE>this._classNames</CODE>. The className
is generated using the <CODE>yui3</CODE> prefix
followed by the value of the <CODE>NAME</CODE> static
property turned lowercase, and then the string given in <CODE>_CLASS_NAMES</CODE>
(this last one will not be turned lowercase), all separated by
hyphens. The <CODE>_classNames</CODE> hash will also
contain the classNames for the <CODE>boundingBox</CODE>
and the <CODE>contentBox</CODE>, the first under the
<CODE>&quot;.&quot;</CODE> key and the second under
the <CODE>&quot;content&quot;</CODE> key. Widget
assigns to the <CODE>boundingBox</CODE> the
classNames derived from the values of the <CODE>NAME</CODE>
property of each of the classes in the inheritance chain, starting
with <CODE>yui3-widget</CODE>. MakeNode stores into
<CODE>this._classNames</CODE> only the top-most
className for the <CODE>boundingBox</CODE>. 
</P>
<P>If the WidgetStdMod module is loaded, MakeNode will also generate
entries for its <CODE>HEADER</CODE>, <CODE>BODY</CODE>
and <CODE>FOOTER</CODE> sections with those same
keys, which are also the constants defined in that same module.</P>
<P>If a component is several levels away from Widget, like
<CODE>SuperSpecialSpinner</CODE> inheriting from
<CODE>SuperSpinner</CODE> which inherits from <CODE>Spinner</CODE>
which inherits from <CODE>Widget,</CODE> and if any
or all of them have <CODE>_CLASS_NAMES</CODE>
properties defined, MakeNode will produce classNames for all of them
and store them in <CODE>this._classNames</CODE>. You
don't need to include at each level the names already declared in the
previous levels. In fact, it is better that you don't since the
classNames produced at each level will use the value of the <CODE>NAME</CODE>
property of that level. Thus, in <CODE>SuperSpecialSpinner</CODE>,
<CODE>{c input}</CODE> will still result in
<CODE>&quot;yui3-spinner-input&quot;</CODE> and not
<CODE>&quot;yui3-superspecialspinner-input&quot;</CODE>
and so it will keep your CSS file still valid.</P>
<H2>The {s} placeholder</H2>
<P>Widget has a <CODE>strings</CODE> configuration
attribute defined, though it is not initialized with any value. This
attribute is meant to hold strings that are visible to (or, via
screen readers, read to) the user. It is important that you never
include visible strings directly in the template. This is not a
requirement of MakeNode — it has never been a good idea at all. All
strings that are to be viewed by or read to the user should always be
placed in the <CODE>strings</CODE> attribute. The
<CODE>strings</CODE> attribute contains a hash where
each individual text is located by its key. The Spinner component has
the following strings, which you can see used in the template above.</P>
<PRE>strings: {
    value: {
        input: &quot;Press the arrow up/down keys for minor increments, page up/down for major increments.&quot;,
        up: &quot;Increment&quot;,
        down: &quot;Decrement&quot;
    }
},</PRE><P>
The best part of doing this is that your component can be localized
to other languages very easily by developers using your component.
When creating an instance of Spinner, you might do:</P>
<PRE>var mySpinner = new Spinner({strings: Y.Intl.get('spinner')});</PRE><P>
Setting the configuration attribute <CODE>strings</CODE>
in this way replaces the default <CODE>strings</CODE>
values with those from the language resource file using the language
previously defined. The <CODE>{s}</CODE> placeholder
accesses the strings stored in the <CODE>strings</CODE>
attribute, either the default ones or the translated ones, if set.
The <CODE>{s xxxx}</CODE> placeholder is, in fact,
nothing more than a shortcut to the <CODE>{@
strings.xxxx}</CODE> placeholder. However, the first can only access
strings at the top level while, for example, <CODE>{@
strings.xxxx.yyyy.zzzz}</CODE> would allow you to access a string
deeper down.</P>
<H2>Using _makeNode in renderUI</H2>
<P>We use the template to create the markup for our component. To do
so, we can call MakeNode's <CODE>_makeNode</CODE>
method, like this:</P>
<PRE>renderUI : function() {
    this.get('contentBox').append(this._makeNode());
},</PRE><P>
This will fill in the <CODE>contentBox</CODE> of our
widget with the markup from processing the template. The <CODE>_makeNode</CODE>
method returns an instance of <CODE>Y.Node</CODE>
which can be appended or inserted anywhere or just held for later
use. It does not return a string, it produces a <CODE>Node</CODE>
instance. If you do need the string and not the node, you can use
method <CODE>_substitute</CODE> which also requires
the template to be specified, it makes no assumptions about any
defaults.</P>
<P>The <CODE>_makeNode</CODE> method takes two
optional arguments: a reference to a template and an object to fill
in placeholders, as <CODE>Y.substitute</CODE> does.
In our simple Spinner example there is a single template for the
whole widget but other widgets might require bits and pieces made out
of several templates. In that case, you would usually call <CODE>_makeNode</CODE>
with no arguments for the main part and call it once again with
different templates to fill in the extra parts. The <A HREF="http://satyam.com.ar/yui/3.0.0/SpinnerTest.html">example</A>
contains this <CODE>renderUI</CODE> method:</P>
<PRE>renderUI: function () {
    var fieldset = this._makeNode();
    this.each(function (item) {
        fieldset.appendChild(this._makeNode(MultipleTemplates.RADIO_TEMPLATE, item));
    }, this);
    this.get('contentBox').append(fieldset);
}</PRE><P>
The first call to <CODE>_makeNode</CODE> returns a
<CODE>Node</CODE> instance stored in the variable
<CODE>fieldset</CODE>. The sample component is also
extended with <CODE>Y.ArrayList</CODE> so the
<CODE>RADIO_TEMPLATE</CODE> will be filled with
values taken from the items stored in the array list and the
resulting Nodes appended to the <CODE>fieldset</CODE>
before it is finally appended to the <CODE>contentBox</CODE>.
The special placeholders such as <CODE>{@} </CODE>or
<CODE>{p}</CODE> will still refer to attributes or
properties in the main object. The nested items will be processed
just as <CODE>Y.substitute </CODE>would.</P>
<H2>The _locateNodes method</H2>
<P>MakeNode further provides a <CODE>_locateNodes</CODE>
method which will try to locate all the elements with the classNames
declared in <CODE>_CLASS_NAMES</CODE>. To locate
specific elements you can pass any number of className keys,
otherwise, <CODE>_locateNodes</CODE> tries them all.
For each element found of each className, <CODE>_locateNodes</CODE>
will produce a private instance property using the underscore prefix
followed by the key name and the <CODE>&quot;Node&quot;</CODE>
suffix. Thus, in our Spinner example, <CODE>_locateNodes</CODE>
will generate the properties <CODE>_inputNode</CODE>,
<CODE>_upNode</CODE> and <CODE>_downNode</CODE>.
If several elements have the same className, <CODE>_locateNodes</CODE>
will return a reference to the first of them. If an element is not
found, no variable will be created.</P>
<P>In the Spinner component we use <CODE>_locateNodes</CODE>
after creating the markup:</P>
<PRE>renderUI : function() {
    this.get(CBX).append(this._makeNode());
    this._locateNodes();
},</PRE><H2>
The _EVENTS static property</H2>
<P>One further property can be defined along the lines of <CODE>_TEMPLATE</CODE>
and <CODE>_CLASS_NAMES</CODE> and that is <CODE>_EVENTS</CODE>.
<CODE>_EVENTS</CODE> will contain a hash made up of
class name keys, each containing a hash of event types and methods to
handle them. It is better explained with an example:</P>
<PRE>_EVENTS: {
    input: {
        change:'_onInputChange'
    },
    '.': {
        key:{
            fn:'_onDirectionKey',
            args:((!Y.UA.opera) ? &quot;down:&quot; : &quot;press:&quot;) + &quot;38, 40, 33, 34&quot;
        },
        mousedown: '_onMouseDown'
    },
    '..': {
        mouseup: '_onDocMouseUp'

    }
},</PRE><P>
<CODE>_EVENTS</CODE> is an object (a hash) with any
number of entries. The names of the properties, that is, the keys of
the hash, identify the nodes whose events we will listen to. They are
the same className keys defined in <CODE>_CLASS_NAMES</CODE>.
There are several extra special keys:</P>
<UL STYLE="margin-left: 0.64cm">
	<LI><P><CODE>&quot;.&quot;</CODE> will refer to the
	bounding box itself.</P>
	<LI><P><CODE>&quot;..&quot;</CODE> refers to the
	document containing this widget.</P>
	<LI><P><CODE>&quot;THIS&quot;</CODE> refers to the
	widget itself</P>
	<LI><P><CODE>&quot;Y&quot;</CODE> refers to the Y
	instance.</P>
</UL>
<P>Think of the first two as doing a <CODE>chdir</CODE>
command when located at the <CODE>boundingBox</CODE>
level. If the Widget has been extended with WidgetStdMod as well, the
keys <CODE>HEADER</CODE>, <CODE>BODY</CODE>
and <CODE>FOOTER</CODE> will refer to those sections
since they will be available in the <CODE>_classNames</CODE>
hash. JavaScript does not need the keys to be quoted if they are
valid identifiers so, except for the dots, the others don't need to
be quoted.</P>
<P>The <CODE>_EVENTS</CODE> property is processed
after the <CODE>renderUI</CODE>, <CODE>bindUI</CODE>
and <CODE>syncUI</CODE> methods have been called so
the widget is expected to be already inserted within the document
body, otherwise the <CODE>&quot;..&quot;</CODE> will
fail. 
</P>
<P>Each of the entries in <CODE>_EVENTS</CODE> is a
further object that uses the type of event as its key and the name of
an instance method to handle it. <CODE>_EVENTS</CODE>,
being a static variable, has no access to <CODE>this</CODE>
so it cannot take actual function references, only the name of the
event listener method. Some event types need extra arguments, such as
the <CODE>key</CODE> event. In that case, instead of
providing the name of the event handler you can provide an object
with properties <CODE>fn</CODE> and <CODE>args</CODE>
to hold the function name and the extra arguments, when required. 
</P>
<P>MakeNode will use <CODE>Node.delegate</CODE> to
listen to the events of the elements within the <CODE>boundingBox</CODE>,
while it will use <CODE>Y.after</CODE> to listen to
events from the <CODE>boundingBox</CODE> and the
document body. It will use <CODE>this.after</CODE> to
listen to events under the <CODE>THIS</CODE> key and
also <CODE>Y.after</CODE> for listeners listed under
the <CODE>Y</CODE> key. All events are listened to
using <I>after</I> event listeners since they are meant to make the
widget respond to events, not to filter the behavior of the object
that fires them so in no case these events can be prevented or
stopped. (Note: listening to the <CODE>key</CODE>
event on any nested element works only with version 3.4.0pr1 and
above, since delegation of the <CODE>key</CODE> event
was not available before. All the other features work with previous
versions as well).</P>
<P>The <CODE>_EVENTS</CODE> declarations are
cumulative when components inherit from one another. Each class in
the inheritance chain will have its own <CODE>_EVENTS</CODE>
declaration processed separately.</P>
<H2>The _ATTRS_2_UI static property</H2>
<P>Events go both ways, from the UI to the component and from the
component to the UI. The first are handled by the <CODE>_EVENTS</CODE>
property. Then there are the events fired by attribute value changes
that need to be reflected in the user interface. As I mentioned in
the previous article, when there are any secondary effects from
changing a configuration attribute, they should be handled by <I>change</I>
event listeners, not by the optional <CODE>setter</CODE>
method of the attribute, which should only deal with normalizing the
value being set. The UI should reflect the state of the configuration
attributes, first in <CODE>syncUI</CODE>, when being
initialized and then on every attribute change event. For the latter,
we need to attach an event listener, which we would normally do in
<CODE>bindUI</CODE>. Widget already provides a
mechanism to make that simple, which I described in the comments to
the previous article.</P>
<P>Widget uses the instance property <CODE>_UI_ATTRS</CODE>
that contains an object with two further properties, <CODE>SYNC</CODE>
and <CODE>BIND</CODE>. Each of these is an array
listing the names of the configuration attributes to be initially
synched and then listened to in order to keep the UI reflecting
current values. Widget expects each of those entries to have a method
associated with it, named after the attribute name prefixed by <CODE>_uiSet</CODE>
with the first character of the attribute name converted to uppercase
to have the method name in proper camel case. Thus, if <CODE>&quot;value&quot;</CODE>
was listed in any of the <CODE>_UI_ATTRS</CODE>
arrays (in either <CODE>SYNC</CODE> or <CODE>BIND</CODE>),
Widget would expect to find a <CODE>_uiSetValue</CODE>
method. This method will receive two arguments, the <CODE>value</CODE>
being set and the <CODE>src</CODE> of the change.
This is the code for our Spinner <CODE>_uiSetValue</CODE>
method:</P>
<PRE>_uiSetValue : function(value, src) {
    if (src === UI) {
        return;
    }
    this._inputNode.set(VALUE, this.get(FORMATTER)(value));
},</PRE><P>
All the uppercase identifiers you see in this piece of code
correspond to string constants declared elsewhere, to allow the YUI
compressor to do its job better. The method, basically, sets the
<CODE>value</CODE> HTML attribute in the <CODE>&lt;input&gt;</CODE>
box to the new value set, after being formatted. The reference to the
textbox was provided by <CODE>_locateNodes</CODE>.
The <CODE>src</CODE> argument is initially checked to
see if set to the string value <CODE>'ui'</CODE>. If
this is so, no action will be taken. This is to avoid endless loops.
If the user enters something in the input box, its value would go
into the <CODE>value</CODE> configuration attribute
which then would fire a <CODE>valueChange</CODE>
event, which would get <CODE>_uiSetValue</CODE>
called which, if unchecked, would then go and change the value of the
input box, which would trigger the whole process again. Thus, in
<CODE>_uiSetValue</CODE>, if we know the change comes
from the UI, we do nothing and so break the loop. However, this
requires another piece of code elsewhere. In the listener for the DOM
event, when we set the configuration attribute, we use the third
optional argument to set, like this:</P>
<PRE>_afterValueChange : function(ev) {
    this.set(VALUE, ev.newVal, {src: UI});
}</PRE><P>
It is up to us to ensure that changes coming from the UI are flagged
thus and then check that same flag to avoid loops. Do use the
identifier <CODE>src</CODE> when setting the value of
the attribute, not <CODE>source</CODE> which will not
be recognized.</P>
<P>With all this said, I haven't yet talked about the static property
<CODE>_ATTRS_2_UI</CODE> mentioned in the heading of
this section. As the comments in my previous article shows (through
the blunders I made in them), making sure that all attributes
affecting the UI are properly listed is somewhat messy. You should
never initialize <CODE>_UI_ATTRS</CODE> from scratch
since Widget already lists a whole lot of attributes and those would
be lost. You have to concatenate new attribute names over the
existing ones, which is somewhat hard to remember how to do it right.
To make it simple, MakeNode will read from the static property
<CODE>_ATTRS_2_UI</CODE> and do that concatenation
for you. It will concatenate all such lists from each and every class
in the inheritance chain so at each level each class can handle its
own attributes. In Spinner, we have:</P>
<PRE>_ATTRS_2_UI: {
    BIND: VALUE,
    SYNC: VALUE
},</PRE><P>
MakeNode will accept both an array of names or a single attribute
name, as in this case. 
</P>
<P>The question naturally arises, why two lists, one for binding the
other for syncing? <CODE>SYNC</CODE> is used the
first time around, after the <CODE>renderUI</CODE>
and <CODE>bindUI</CODE> methods, if they exist, are
called and before <CODE>syncUI</CODE> while those
listed in <CODE>BIND</CODE> will be bound to the
corresponding attributes for later changes. Quite often the <CODE>SYNC</CODE>
array has fewer entries than the <CODE>BIND</CODE>
list and this is because the template for the component might already
have the very same default value as the configuration attribute and
there is no need to do an initial syncing. So, if the default value
for the <CODE>value</CODE> configuration attribute is
an empty string and the <CODE>&lt;input&gt;</CODE>
element in the template has no <CODE>value</CODE>
attribute, then there is no need to sync them on initialization.</P>
<P>Attributes listed in <CODE>BIND</CODE> will have
their <CODE>_uiSet</CODE><CODE><I>Xxxx</I></CODE>
methods called in any order, as attributes can be set in any order.
Attributes listed in <CODE>SYNC</CODE> will be called
once in the order in which they are listed and, if one is dependent
on another (which they shouldn't) the order might be important.</P>
<P>MakeNode will check for duplicate entries in any of these arrays.
If any appear, it means that a class our component inherits from
already handles this attribute and any new declaration would most
likely overstep the <CODE>_uiSet</CODE><CODE><I>Xxxx</I></CODE>
handler for it. Incidentally, MakeNode also checks for duplicate
entries in <CODE>_CLASS_NAMES</CODE>, which can also
cause conflict in some, though not all, circumstances. MakeNode will
write a message to the log for any such error.</P>
<H2>The _PUBLISH property</H2>
<P>Finally, the <CODE>_PUBLISH</CODE> static property
will list those events that have to be published. It contains a hash
using the name of the event as its keys and an object literal of
configuration attributes as its values. It will publish all the
events listed in any such property in all the inheritance chain. The
same event name can be published in a class and in any class
inheriting from it which will make  the configuration attributes of
later ones override the ones in the older ones, for example, you
might want to make an existing event broadcast globally. Just as with
the <CODE>_EVENTS</CODE>, since <CODE>_PUBLISH</CODE>
is a static property without access to <CODE>this</CODE>,
when specifying functions, it is the name of the method, as a string,
that needs to be given.</P>
<H2>Conclusion</H2>
<P>MakeNode provides a very simple template processor, with simple
functionality that is highly integrated with the Widget foundation
class. It also provides helper methods to create classNames to be
used in the template and to use those names to locate and refer to
the nodes created. It also provides the means to hook into the events
generated both by the UI and the component itself and associate each

good range of them. Nevertheless, it does not preclude you from
adding extra functionality. You might rarely have to write a <CODE>bindUI</CODE>
or <CODE>syncUI</CODE> method if you use the glue
provided by MakeNode, but you may do so, since MakeNode does not use
them.</P>

also modified Anthony Pipkin's Button set of gallery components and
made an Accordion and TimeSpinner components, all available in the
