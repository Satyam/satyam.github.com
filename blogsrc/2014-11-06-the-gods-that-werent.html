  I finally made it, the story that has been in my mind for several years now,
  with a bit written here, another one over there until I finally put it all
  together.

<p>
  Now that I see it done, my first reaction is to apologize. It is probably not
  a good story and most certainly not well written. Without an editor or anybody
  to review it, it is probably awful. But I wanted to have the experience of
  doing it, making sure it all fits together and wrapping it up nicely. If you
  think it is an ego trip, indeed, you are right!
</p>
<p>
  It was quite an experience. As I started to stitch together the bits and
  pieces, characters started to show up. Events happened on their own. I just
  had to write them down. The character who has the privilege of having the
  closing line of the whole book to her name had never been in my plans at all.
</p>
<p>
  One reason I had no reviewers is that it is a science-fiction book, a genre
  that is not terribly popular. And I mean SciFi, not fantasy-SciFi, and I seem
  to be the only one around who cares for that.
</p>
<p>
  And, it is in English It is not my native language and I live in Spain so it
  seems a strange choice. But, as it happens, most of the science-fiction I have
  ever read was in English and most of what I read related to science and
  technology is in English too so, as it turns out, I don´t have enough
  vocabulary in Spanish to say what I wanted.

  Now, I am experimenting with this self-publishing thing. This page and this
  post are part of the experiment. If you are reading this, thanks for your
  patience.
