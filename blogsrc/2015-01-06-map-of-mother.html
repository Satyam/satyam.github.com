                I had never managed to make a good picture of Mother in my mind.
                 In the end, it didn´t really matter, but I always felt there
                was something missing and inconsistent.  I knew there had to be
                coast at and around 0º latitude, 0º longitude or, in Mother´s
                terms, `0 grads fall´, and that there is where Pinnacle should
                be, however, I never made my mind whether the sea should be to
                the north of Pinnacle City or to the south and, mostly, I
                imagined the coastline running east to west but why should it be
                so, why couldn´t it run north to south or any other direction in
                between?<span class="more"></span>

                I realized that this is the image of Mother I had been looking
                for.  I feel Pinnacle should be somewhere in the large bay
                enclosed within the main fishhook continent. Anywhere there
                would do, more or less, it doesn´t matter that much.
              </p>
              <p>
                What I liked of this map, which made me realize the
                misconception I had is that the main continent does not need to
                extend completely to the south or completely to the north of
                Pinnacle.  In a few drafts I made early on I had a horizontal
                line for the equator and then one blob of a continent either
                completely above or completely below that equator line.  That
                was it, pretty simple but also very artificial and
                unrealistic.   This map shows a far more credible distribution
                of landmasses that I ever imagined as well as various features
                like fertile and arid lands, lakes, rivers and mountains, and
                still works for the purpose of the novel.

                Science fiction is always about exploring the edges of the known
                universe.  My mental image of Mother was too limited, too
                simple, very poor, it showed a complete lack of imagination.  I
                am happy that this image allowed me to go beyond those bounds.
