                Having pods speeding down the ribbon towards either planet is no
                joke. What if anything fails?

                On Earth, something falling from the moon towards the Earth
                would reach the atmosphere at close to 40 thousand kilometers
                per hour. That was the speed the Apollo capsules had when they
                reached the atmosphere where they slowed down by friction. That
                is why the recent test flight of the new NASA capsule Orion was
                such a big deal, could the thermal shield protect the capsule?
                Since Apollo 17, no spacecraft has re-entered the atmosphere at
                such speed. Orion hasn´t gone that fast, but it was far faster
                than any man-rated vehicle has since Apollo.

                Anyway, back to the novel, what to do with a failing falling
                pad? If the problem is detected soon enough, the best is to
                discard it. The two halves of the climber, one on each side of
                the ribbon, would simply separate and fall away. The easiest and
                lightest would be explosive bolts, frequently used when
                separating rocket stages, which would also provide a light push
                to each half away from the ribbon. From the midway point up to a
                certain height, the halves would eventually burn up in the
                atmosphere. It would help if the cargo bay opens and the
                contents spread, since that would ensure everything burns up
                faster. However, if this is done very high, the remains might
                get into orbit. That is not good since in that case, they would
                eventually return to the point where they had detached from the
                cable and hit it. That is in theory, in practice, it´s anyone´s
                guess. Due to many perturbation factors, the chances of actually
                hitting the cable are small.
              </p>
              <p>
                The highest chance would be if the two halves are ejected in the
                direction of the ecliptic, meaning one eastwards, the other
                westwards. Even then, the cable is continuously vibrating like a
                guitar string, very slowly, but enough to move away from the
                debris at the right moment. By tensioning the cable or changing
                the speed on the remaining pods, that movement can be adjusted
                to avoid the debris. If ejected in a polar direction, the cable
                and the pod remains would meet only after very many orbits, that
                is, if the pods don´t slow down due to friction in the
                atmosphere and burn down before that happens, which is the whole
                point.

                If the linear induction motor works all the way down and the
                parachutes fail, an extra set of parachutes could be sent up via
                a small sounding rocket or a weather balloon tethered to the
                cable. As the pod comes down, it would entangle itself in the
                tether and pull the parachute out of the rocket or balloon.

                An idea that fascinated me was what if that is not enough. I
                remembered how the catapult of an aircraft carrier is stopped
                after it has released the plane. The piston runs in a tube which
                has injectors for water jets that swirl around the inside of the
                tube. The jets point towards the incoming piston but at an angle
                so the water remains attached to the tube, being centrifuged by
                its own speed. The front end of the piston is shaped so it
                scrapes the water from the tube and sends it back through the
                center of the tube. The tube is open towards the bow of the
                aircraft carrier so after every plane departs, the catapult
                spits a jet of water right behind it.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, in the case of the ribbon, two water jets could be sent
                upwards one on each face of the ribbon. The pod would have its
                front shaped like a snowplow. Scraping the water from the ribbon
                and sending it sideways or, preferably, back down, would eat up
                a lot of the speed. Remember that this would only be used if the
                induction motor did work so the pod would be falling at a few
                hundred kph, not tens of thousands. At that kind of speed, the
                pod would not go fast enough to burn in the atmosphere if
                released. For the final stop, a net can be deployed at the top
                of Pinnacle or its counterpart in Heaven, like those deployed in
                aircraft carriers to catch plans whose landing hook is damaged.

                I would have loved to put this in the novel but it seemed it
                would lengthen that chapter too much. It is already dense with
                technical details, it didn´t need any more.
