  Perhaps I should have drawn this map before starting the novel but I did it a
  couple of days ago. The place changed as the action demanded so it would have
  required me to keep changing it so I prefered to keep it in my mind instead of
  grabbing the pencil. Now, since the novel is published, the map is not going
  to change anymore, so I did it.

  It shows just a section of the city. I coloured the water blue, some parks
  green, the city blocks grey, the railroad station red, the Great Temple pink.
  The city extends well beyond what is shown in this page but, since no action
  takes place there, I didn´t bother. The only part missing here is Cape Farsi
  (chapter 12) which would be further to the right along the Promenade.

  Pinnacle is the peninsula at the bottom. The Observatory would be the black
  circle on the road spiralling up on the fake hill. The Great Temple is the
  large pink building with the esplanade in front of it, surrounded by other
  buildings. After the main gate, the causeway leads to the roundabout when it
  crosses the Promenade and then the big Boulevard of Elvar the Peacifier. To
  its left is the old city, recognizable by its twisted random streets and then
  the basin, the port for the river barges. Some non-square city blocks remained
  on the right hand side of the boulevard which were also part of the old city.
  The boulevard had actually cut through the old town and new buildings were
  build facing it, but parts of the old city remain in the back streets.
</p>
<p>
  The sea port is on the left of Pinnacle and a set of locks connects it to the
  basin. Railroad tracks for cargo run along both the basin, on the far left
  side, and along the main piers of the sea port. The buildings in that area are
  mostly warehouses.
</p>
<p>
  Elvar Blvd. ends in the secondary canal, which turns inland somewhere beyond
  the right edge of this map. The main canal comes from the top left corner
  which goes past a last set of locks before crossing under the railroad tracks
  and then entering the basin.
</p>
<p>
  Perhaps the area in between the secondary canal and the railroad station
  should not have square blocks. It didn´t matter to the story and I felt it was
  good enough like this. The city would continue on the other side of the
  railroad station and the tracks, but I didn´t quite bother. Also, beyond the
  locks on the upper-left corner, branches of the canal should spread into the
  suburbs and later into the farmland.
