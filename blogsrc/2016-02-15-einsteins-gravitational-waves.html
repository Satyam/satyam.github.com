                As we can feel the wind in a moving sailboat and figure out
                which way and how fast we are moving, someone thought that, as
                we are traveling through space in our own planet Earth, we
                should be able to somehow <em>feel the wind</em>. If we can
                perceive the slight differences in the speed of the light of the
                stars coming towards us from different directions, we might
                figure out where are we going and how fast and, most
                intriguingly, where did we come from.<span class="more"></span>

                This was not practical until late in the 19th century. The speed
                of our Earth was minuscule against the speed of light so there
                was no way to detect such a subtle difference within the margin
                of error in our measurement of the speed of light.
              </p>
              <p>
                When this became possible there was a big surprise, even the
                most sensitive instruments, some built on purpose to measure
                this, could not detect any difference. Light came at exactly the
                very same speed from absolutely everywhere. Could it be that we
                are completely still at the exact center of the Universe and
                everything moves around us? That sounds more theology than
                cosmology.
              </p>
              <p>
                The measurement got so precise that it should have been able to
                detect the Earth rotation on its axis or its orbit around the
                sun. Even if we believed in an unmovable Earth at the center of
                the Universe, the relative movements of other bodies relative to
                us should be detectable. But, still, nothing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many theories were developed that fitted the observed facts. The
                most elaborate assumed that our rulers shortened in the
                direction of the movement and since speed is distance over time,
                if the ruler measuring distance shortened, we weren´t getting
                the speed reading right. Numerically, it worked wonderfully but
                explained nothing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then came Einstein who more or less thought, what if the speed
                of light is constant? He started to work the equations based on
                that assumption and, voilá, we got the Special Theory of
                Relativity in 1905. Instead of having arbitrary equations that
                fitted the numbers but had no underlying justification, he
                started from a single principle, that the speed of light was
                constant, and came up with the equations that fitted the
                observations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Though we talk about the speed of light as a constant, what we
                actually mean is that there is a maximum speed in the Universe
                and nothing can go faster than that, light included. Would-be
                inventors wonder if there could be something other than light
                that can go faster but it is not like we have a race-car called
                light that happens to max-out at that speed but some other more
                powerful race-car could beat it. It is not light that puts the
                limit, it is the Universe that sets it and light just goes as
                fast as it could possibly go.
              </p>
              <p>
                Photons, the particles light is made of, are like `flubber´ the
                magical bouncy thing in The Absent-minded Professor, and I am
                thinking the Fred McMurray version not the recent one with Robin
                Williams. Photons have no mass so, it doesn´t require any force
                at all to get them going. It is basic Newtonian mechanics, F
                (force) = m (mass) * a (acceleration) or, a = F / m. If
                <strong>m</strong> is 0, <strong>a</strong> turns infinite, no
                matter what the force might be. Thus, like flubber bouncing all
                over the lab, the moment photons get just the slightest touch,
                they accelerate up to the maximum possible speed.
              </p>

                Ten years after Special Relativity, now a century ago, Einstein
                published the General Theory of Relativity. He thought, if a
                particle does not speed up beyond the speed of light, it is as
                if its mass grows larger. The faster it goes, the more massive
                it becomes, <em>heavier</em> if you wish. By the time it reaches
                the speed of light, the mass becomes infinite and no matter how
                much we push, the particle is not going to go any faster.

                It might sound as an explanation no better than rulers magically
                shortening in the direction of movement. Why mass would grow
                with speed? Well, we actually don´t know why but, and here is
                the beauty of it, if we assume that mass does increase, we can
                make predictions on how things should behave and, if those
                predictions come true, the original assumption should be true.
                Even in Einstein´s time, some of the predictions took several
                years until they could be confirmed and one of them,
                gravitational waves, has just been confirmed a century after it
                had been predicted. Not that anyone seriously doubted it would
                be true, the problem was that the effect is so minuscule that we
                couldn´t make instruments sensitive enough to detect it.<strong>
                  It is an achievement of experimental science</strong>
                since the theory, Einstein´s, was not in doubt.

                This change in the mass of moving objects is what relates mass
                to the speed of light. The closer to the speed limit of the
                Universe an object travels, the heavier it gets. By playing a
                little bit with the equations, we get to the famous E = mc², an
                equation which has been thoroughly proved by thousands of
                nuclear explosions and many nuclear power plants.

                The existence of a speed limit in the Universe means that
                nothing can get instantaneously to anywhere else.  So far we had
                verified that over all the electromagnetic spectrum, of which
                light is a part of.  Both optical and radio telescopes confirm
                that.  Now we have another type of waves, not electromagnetic
                but gravitational waves, and they also comply. This is further
                prove that the Universe has a speed limit.  We call it the speed
                of light but it is more fundamental than that.  It is not just
                light, gravitational waves also travel at that top speed.

                Galileo first pointed his primitive telescope to the planets and
                by discovering Jupiter´s moons started modern observational
                astronomy.  Newton´s reflector telescope allowed us to build
                larger and more capable telescopes.  It wasn´t until the 1930´s
                that engineers working on microwave transmission equipment for a
                large phone company figured out that the noise they were getting
                was coming from the stars and, thus, radio-astronomy was born.
                 So far, we had been limited to light, now we could see the
                whole electromagnetic spectrum of which light is just a small
                part.

                Gravitational waves are a completely new way to see the
                Universe.  It is like a completely new sense, as if we could
                suddenly grow ears and perceive the Universe beyond what our
                eyes can see.  The instrument that managed to pick those waves
                are two enormous installations of several kilometers in length
                each at two different locations.  All these was needed just to
                confirm an effect so subtle that it took a century from its
                prediction to develop the technology to make it possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now that we have confirmed that we have the technology capable
                of sensing them scientists might get the go ahead to build even
                more sensitive instruments capable of looking at the Universe
                with this new sense.

                Dark matter (or dark energy, since mass and energy are
                interchangeable) is dark in the electromagnetic spectrum but it
                does have mass, that is why we figure out it must be there.  We
                might finally be able to confirm its existence.
              </p>
              <p>
                What else might be out there? We are starting to have the means
                to find out.
