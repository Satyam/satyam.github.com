  I wrote about what makes fantasy different from science-fiction. Fantasy is
  limitless, it is magical, science-fiction has restrictions, limits and
  constraints just as real life.

  However, a novel later developed into a series comes to my mind,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Goes_Away"
    >The Magic Goes Away</a
  >
  by Larry Niven. Though it is still quite unrealistic, it does have one
  important feature of a science-fiction novel, magic is becoming scarce because
  it has been overused. This restriction places this novel just a little bit
  away from pure fantasy, not anything can just happen on a whim, there are
  rules and limits, in this case a limited quantity. Then you avoid issues like
  the omnipotence paradox: can an omnipotent being create a wall it cannot break
  through?
