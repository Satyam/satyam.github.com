                “Initially the ribbons were curved in gentle spirals around the
                center but as they spread, they straightened out. The outer tips
                of each ribbon were tied to the tips of its neighbors which
                forced the ribbons to turn and lay all flat facing the sun.”

                Deployment of a solar array is easy when you assume a flexible
                super-strong material as in the novel, but it can also be done
                if you have rigid solar cells as shown here:  <iframe                   src="//player.vimeo.com/video/103446030"
