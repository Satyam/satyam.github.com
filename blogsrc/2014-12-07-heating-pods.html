                Eduardo Longoni, a very smart guy I´ve been lucky to work with,
                was well-known amongst amateur radio operators. When an
                opportunity came up for them to design and launch an amateur
                radio relay satellite he was quite excited. I was surprised to
                find that his main area of interest in that project was heat. I
                knew heat in space was an issue, but I didn´t quite think it was
                something to get so excited about.

                Perhaps it is thanks to him that I´ve been somewhat careful to
                explai<span class="text_exposed_show"
                  >n how pods would deal with heat. After all, any large
                  electrical motor does produce heat, they even have fins to
                  keep them cool. In space, there is no air for a fan to move
                  about. In the space elevator, the electrical motor is part on
                  the pod itself and the other part is the ribbon, were
                  electrical currents are induced, which might warm up
                  dangerously to the point of melting or even burning. After
                  all, any object at such a height above the surface of a planet
                  does have a lot of potential energy and, if you want it to
                  come to rest at the planet surface, all that energy has to go
                  somewhere.</span>

                  So, that is why I devoted a few sentences to explaining how
                  the heat would be dealt with and how it imposed serious
                  limitations on the speed of the pods.

                  What I have been not so keen to talk about was about
                  vibration. After all, those long ribbons are like guitar
                  strings ready to be plucked. If vibration gets out of hand,
                  bad things happen, like in the famous Tacoma Narrows bridge,
                  but I admit I don´t know enough to even discuss the subject.
                  My guess is that by carefully spacing the pods, probably not
                  at regular intervals, controlling their acceleration and
                  braking so as not to make stationary waves and adjusting the
                  tension on the cable itself, excessive vibration can be
                  controlled, but I really don´t know that much about that.
