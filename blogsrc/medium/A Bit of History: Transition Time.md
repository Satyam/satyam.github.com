The 80s was a time of transition in the PC industry and I was lucky enough to live through it. I am from Argentina and still lived in Buenos Aires in those years. The Internet as we know it didn't exist yet and global trade didn't quite reach us down south so things moved more slowly. Some things didn't get there at all. In the personal computer arena, it was only 8-bit CP/M and later IBM PC and its clones. No Apple and no Unix at all mostly because there were no local distributors or subsidiaries to import, sale or support them. 

----

It was a different environment from what then popular magazines such as Byte Magazine showed us, but I worked for a very forward-looking company that tried to ride the wave of innovation so I wasn't quite behind technologically.  And several of our customers were also interested in the advances they read about so they kept us on our toes. The company dealt with several ranges of computers but I'll focus on the personal computers, since we still use their descendants.

Of course, the decade started with the very first model of IBM PC which had us all very excited. Until then, in the personal computer line, 8-bit CP/M machines usually based on the Zilog Z80 processor were our best choice. Many corporate customers had dozens of them, mostly smuggled beneath the radar of their IT departments where the mainframe ruled. They dismissed them as 'toys' or perhaps little more than a sophisticated electric typewriter. And, indeed, many were purchased as such. WordStar was everywhere, WordPerfect was superb, though expensive. Mind you, the laser printer was still years away, it was all dot-matrix impact printers with its poor resolution, by today's standards, but back then it spoke of progress, future. Later we had daisy-wheel printers such as the Xerox Diablo 630, which gave us the same quality as an IBM Selectric.

The spreadsheet, specially SuperCalc, changed the balance. The personal computers started to creep into departments that were the main focus of IT services, such as finance or accountancy, and they didn't like it. Discussions about the purchase of just a few machines might reach the highest levels of management.

At that time, IBM Argentina was overtaking the whole computer market. Many banks and other large corporations had mainframes from NCR, Bull, Burroughs or Univac, but IBM was winning over them and had, by far, the largest market share and still growing. No IT department boss would be fired for selecting IBM, nobody dared going with any competitor.

And then, the bombshell, the original IBM PC. Now, there was a PC with the IBM brand on it. IT departments could no longer ignore the PC. IBM Argentina itself tried. Customers asked IBM what was this PC thing everyone was talking about. But IBM was making too much money out of mainframes and all related equipment. Its sales force wasn't keen on letting that market fizzle. They made all kind of excuses not to sale the PC. I am not saying that it was the official policy of the company but that is what the customers got from their sales representatives. 

However, just as with the earlier 8-bit CP/M machines, PC-clones started to creep in. Most of the software available on their earlier machines was available on the PC-clones, SuperCalc, WordStar, WordPerfect, it was all the same, no re-training needed. It would take a while for IBM to give in and with the IBM PS/2 they finally went full in. They were expensive and hardware incompatible with all the rest so they could still make their juicy sales numbers and keep the competition at bay. And though they sold thousands of those, for the customers the numbers didn't add up. Not just the cost of the machines but its performance soon became dismal. Though they were decent at the start, the clones kept advancing in performance and going down on price, and IBM with its steady, slow pace couldn't keep up. IT departments couldn't justify the cost of upgrading their expensive PS/2s. Some were even regretting their earlier decision to buy those initial PS/2s.
