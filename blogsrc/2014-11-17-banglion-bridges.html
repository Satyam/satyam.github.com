  “The bridge was an elegant slender structure made in concrete but was covered
  with the typical red brick of the region for decoration.”

  When I wrote this I was thinking of this bridge, the new one in the
  background, in Albi, France where red bricks are used profusely. The
  foreground bridge is the original one, the one in the background (only one
  arch is visible in between the trees) is the modern one, build in concrete and
  covered in red brick just to match the surrounding area.
