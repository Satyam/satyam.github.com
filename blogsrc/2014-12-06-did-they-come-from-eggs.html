                The worlds in the novel have very long days, much like our Moon
                does, about two weeks daylight, two weeks nighttime. Their
                inhabitants, both man and beast, have adapted to that cycle by
                hibernating during the night. However, would this be really
                possible for humans or, in general, for viviparous mammals? It
                should be Ok for adults but what about babies?

                Babies would have to be born early in the day, which should not
                be much of an issue. When the baby is ready, actual del<span                   class="text_exposed_show"
                  >ivery is triggered by hormones and part of the adjustment to
                  the day/night cycle would be to generate those hormones.
                  During their first day babies would need to grow and gain
                  enough weight during that first daylight period to survive
                  their first hibernation. Maternities would have a really hard
                  job early every morning, with all expecting mothers due on
                  that day giving birth to their child almost all at once. The
                  later in the day a baby was born, the less likely he would
                  survive.</span>

                  I didn´t think making our characters too alien would add much
                  to the story, thus I made them very, very human. However, I
                  never said they weren´t born from eggs.
