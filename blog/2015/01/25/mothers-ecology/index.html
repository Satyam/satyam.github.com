              <p>
                I was tempted to make some mention to Mother’s ecology but in
                the end I gave up. I wanted to provide clues as to the origin of
                Mother of which I will say no more to give away the story.  The
                problem was how to say it without comparing it to Earth’s own
                ecology because in that world, Earth is not known to exist thus,
                to be self-consistent, the novel cannot make such
                comparisons.<span id="more-384"></span>
              </p>
              <p>
                Obviously, Earth exists and we are here and it is us who read
                the novel but making references to Earth would take the reader
                out of that fantasy world, put a distance in between the reader
                and the subjects in the novel. If the reader was immersed in
                that world, we suddenly wake her/him up out of it.
              </p>
              <p>
                If we took that idea to the extreme, the best would be to write
                the novel in Mother’s own language ignoring any terrestrial
                languages so the novel would be totally self-consistent, the
                immersion would be complete.  The Coriolis effect I mention
                somewhere in the novel would have to be called after whomever
                described it first in that world. Everything would have to be
                written in terms, language and expressions an inhabitant of
                Mother would understand.  It would be as if Tolkien wrote The
                Hobbit in runes or whatever the language of each specific
                narrator is.   It wouldn’t have sold many copies or made movies,
                not that I have managed to do either.
              </p>
              <p>
                Going back to ecology.  For example, here on Earth I can mention
                that the Argentinian  Pampas have no native trees, which assumes
                you know what a tree is, a knowledge which would have been
                beyond your reach if you had only known the Pampas as they were
                before colonization.  Likewise, though I could have described
                what there was to be found in Mother, it would have been
                impossible to describe what was missing because, if that was the
                case, nobody in that world would have ever noticed.  Since the
                ecologic hints I wanted to drop at the beginning had to do with
                missing things, I was unable to provide them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course, the ecology was just one such issue.  As I mentioned
                earlier, the language would have been the first.  Should I write
                it in English or in, shall we call it, <em>Motherish</em>?  What
                Earthbound assumptions are safe to make?  Should Mother
                inhabitants be erect bipeds?  Would they use clothes?  Do they
                talk or sign at each other?  Do they have hands to sign with?
              </p>
              <p>
                In the end, unless they are crucial to the story, you let your
                Earthbound assumptions tacitly prevail because you are not
                trying to describe a fantasy world but just tell a story within
                an alien scenery and you don’t want to distract the reader from
                the story.
