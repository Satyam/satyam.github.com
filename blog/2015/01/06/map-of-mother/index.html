                I had never managed to make a good picture of Mother in my mind.
                 In the end, it didn’t really matter, but I always felt there
                was something missing and inconsistent.  I knew there had to be
                coast at and around 0º latitude, 0º longitude or, in Mother’s
                terms, ‘0 grads fall’, and that there is where Pinnacle should
                be, however, I never made my mind whether the sea should be to
                the north of Pinnacle City or to the south and, mostly, I
                imagined the coastline running east to west but why should it be
                so, why couldn’t it run north to south or any other direction in
                between?<span id="more-378"></span>

                I realized that this is the image of Mother I had been looking
                for.  I feel Pinnacle should be somewhere in the large bay
                enclosed within the main fishhook continent. Anywhere there
                would do, more or less, it doesn’t matter that much.
              </p>
              <p>
                What I liked of this map, which made me realize the
                misconception I had is that the main continent does not need to
                extend completely to the south or completely to the north of
                Pinnacle.  In a few drafts I made early on I had a horizontal
                line for the equator and then one blob of a continent either
                completely above or completely below that equator line.  That
                was it, pretty simple but also very artificial and
                unrealistic.   This map shows a far more credible distribution
                of landmasses that I ever imagined as well as various features
                like fertile and arid lands, lakes, rivers and mountains, and
                still works for the purpose of the novel.
              </p>

                Science fiction is always about exploring the edges of the known
                universe.  My mental image of Mother was too limited, too
                simple, very poor, it showed a complete lack of imagination.  I
                am happy that this image allowed me to go beyond those bounds.
