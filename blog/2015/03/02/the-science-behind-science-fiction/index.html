              <p>
                Browsing through a bunch of old papers I found a few notes on a
                technology which I meant to use in some novel but dropped it
                because it wasn’t feasible.  Now, you might be wondering, we are
                talking fantasy, right?  What could possibly not be feasible?
                Well, the point is, we are not talking fantasy, we are talking
                science-fiction and though it is fiction, it is not magic, it
                still has to be possible.<span id="more-391"></span>
              </p>
              <p>
                I don’t think I need to tell anybody what scientists call
                ‘wormholes’, they are in all sort of novels, movies or TV
                series. Basically, a sort of tunnel that instantly gets you from
                point A to point B anywhere in the universe.  In science-fiction
                it is usually used to allow interstellar and even intergalactic
                travel possible because, otherwise, it would take so long that
                there would not be any story possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                I wanted to explore it as the scenario for a story, not just as
                an excuse to allow impossibly short interstellar travel times.
                Make those wormholes an everyday thing.  What would happen if
                every morning you could simply walk to your neighborhood portal
                and then go through a wormhole to instantly show up downtown a
                few blocks from your office? How would such a network of
                zillions of portals connecting everywhere with everywhere else
                affect city life?
              </p>
              <p>
                The first obvious thing is that why would you bother living in
                the city? You could commute from your Mediterranean beachside
                home to your South Pole lab just as easily as going around the
                corner.  Instead of ordering pizza, you could have your lunch
                break in Naples savouring the real thing.
              </p>
              <p>
                That is when fantasy starts coming in.  In the real world there
                is a catch, there is always a catch.  Putting it that way ‘<em
                  >there has to be a catch</em
                >‘,  might not be a very scientific assessment but the truth is
                the real world imposes limitations, otherwise it is just fantasy
                and it would be no different than snapping your fingers to move
                from one place to another.
              </p>
              <p>
                One first limitation I meant to impose is that the portals would
                be paired.  You can’t enter a portal and pop up in any other
                portal.  Portals would be permanently paired.  Thus, to get from
                point A to point B you might have to cross several portals.
                 There would be end-nodes in the neighborhoods and connecting
                stations of various sizes so you can transfer from one portal to
                another.  So, that would impose some real-life limitation.
                 Travel would not be instant from wherever to anywhere else, you
                would have to jump several times, walking through the concourses
                of the several intermediate stations and perhaps queuing at each
                portal.
              </p>
              <p>
                Still, there has to be some cost somewhere, not necessarily an
                economic cost but in the real world nothing comes for free.
                 Otherwise, you would be creating something out of nothing.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, the Poles are colder than the Equator.  In the
                cold, the air gets denser so there is higher atmospheric
                pressure.  Then you could set up a series of portals in the
                Arctic paired with sets of portals in the Stadiums for the 2022
                World Cup in Qatar and let the cold Arctic air, at higher
                atmospheric pressure, to flow on its own to cool down the
                fields.  It would save a lot of electricity for the air
                conditioners the Qataris should install to achieve the same.
                That saving means you would be having air conditioning for free.
                 Unfortunately, the world doesn’t work like that.
              </p>
              <p>
                What if you had a portal at the top of a high building paired
                with one in the basement.  You drop a hose on the side of the
                building and connect it to both portals so it all makes a loop.
                 Then you fill it with water.  The water would fall down the
                hose due to gravity, enter the portal in the basement, instantly
                come out of the one on at the top, enter the hose and drop once
                again.  You could put a turbine somewhere and get a lot of power
                for nothing.  That simply can’t happen.
              </p>
              <p>
                There has to be some cost to get through the portal.  Would it
                depend on the distance? The distance from the top of the
                building to its basement might not be that big, but there is a
                difference in gravity potential, would that be the cost?   But
                then, if I put a cost so that generating power out of a hose
                down a building is uneconomical, I would make interstellar
                travel unaffordable. Would it depend on the weight (mass) of the
                object transferred?  What about the cool Arctic air?  If the
                portals are at the same height, there would be no gravitational
                gain, and the air is relatively light so if cost depended on
                weight, it should be cheap to cool down the whole of Qatar.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, I kept thinking about usage examples and I could not figure
                out a reasonable cost structure for the system.  Besides, I had
                no story to tell in that scenario. But the further I dug into
                it, the less realistic I found it.
              </p>
              <p>
                That is what makes science-fiction different from fantasy, there
                has to be some real-world science in it.  Otherwise, it is just
                magic.
