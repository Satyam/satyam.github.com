                I finally made it, the story that has been in my mind for
                several years now, with a bit written here, another one over
                there until I finally put it all together.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now that I see it done, my first reaction is to apologize. It is
                probably not a good story and most certainly not well written.
                Without an editor or anybody to review it, it is probably awful.
                But I wanted to have the experience of doing it, making sure it
                all fits together and wrapping it up nicely. If you thin<span
                  class="text_exposed_show"
                  >k it is an ego trip, indeed, you are right!</span
                >
              </p>
              <div class="text_exposed_show">
                <p>
                  It was quite an experience. As I started to stitch together
                  the bits and pieces, characters started to show up. Events
                  happened on their own. I just had to write them down. The
                  character who has the privilege of having the closing line of
                  the whole book to her name had never been in my plans at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One reason I had no reviewers is that it is a science-fiction
                  book, a genre that is not terribly popular. And I mean SciFi,
                  not fantasy-SciFi, and I seem to be the only one around who
                  cares for that.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And, it is in English It is not my native language and I live
                  in Spain so it seems a strange choice. But, as it happens,
                  most of the science-fiction I have ever read was in English
                  and most of what I read related to science and technology is
                  in English too so, as it turns out, I don’t have enough
                  vocabulary in Spanish to say what I wanted.
                </p>

                  Now, I am experimenting with this self-publishing thing. This
                  page and this post are part of the experiment. If you are
                  reading this, thanks for your patience.
