              <p>
                I didn’t like Interstellar, the recent SciFi movie. I admit that
                for a hard SciFi fan who likes more nuts and bolts, not dragons
                and melodramatics, all the talk about love being such a force of
                nature, all those long scenes with lots of tears and sorrow were
                a little too much but, well, I am sure it is suitable for a part
                of the audience. Lets accept that.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, what I do expect of a story is self-consistency. I
                tried very hard to be consistent within my novel, I re-wrote
                several parts to be consistent and I get really disappointed
                when I see such a ballyhooed movie fail so badly.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ve all seen small spaceships landing and taking off from
                planets such as tie fighters in Star Wars or shuttle craft in
                Star Trek. Interstellar has its own version of these, however,
                why did they need something that looked pretty much like a
                Saturn V for their first jump into space to join the rest of
                their ship which was already assembled in orbit? Either their
                craft can or cannot raise from planets with a similar gravity
                pull as Earth, either they need a Saturn V or they don’t.
              </p>
              <p>
                They take 2 years to travel from Earth to Saturn via Mars, which
                is a reasonable time with current technology. However, once
                across the wormhole and in another galaxy, they are able to jump
                in between planets in different star systems in less than a
                lifetime. Are the stars in that other galaxy packed so close
                together that they allow travel in between them so fast?
                Because, if they are, it would probably be a chaotic place,
                dangerous and full of radiation from so many celestial bodies
                around hurtling big rocks at each other. Our star is a mild one
                located in a quiet spot on our galaxy. If you are looking for a
                safe place for humanity to live forever, you would hardly look
                at a place where too many star systems are packed so dangerously
                close together.
              </p>
              <p>
                And why does it need to be in some other galaxy? If you can
                travel fast enough to go in between star systems, why not go to
                other star systems within our own neighborhood, in this same
                galaxy.
              </p>
              <p>
                When they first reach orbit and are about to dock to the station
                everyone except, fortunately, for the pilot, jumps off their
                seats excited like children, to watch the show, at the worst
                possible moment to do so. Whenever a plane lands both passengers
                and crew must be seated with their seat belts adjusted but in
                Interstellar, frolicking around the cabin is normal procedure
                for docking.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then, there is the scene where they stop the craft from spinning
                just because. As far as can be seen, only 2 of the crew of four
                are there present. And so, without warning anybody or,
                aparently, without any prior preparation, the pilot fires the
                attitude rockets to stop the spin. I hope that nobody was frying
                some eggs in the galley at that point or peeing.
              </p>
              <p>
                The station was a very bad design. That ring with a single spoke
                was absurd. Imagine you had a bike with a wheel like that, with
                a single spoke. It can be done but, then, you know it is going
                to be a very heavy wheel because it has to be very robust to
                transmit all the forces around the rim and through that single
                spoke to the hub. A spinning space station is subject to the
                same principles. Whenever the crew meets in one place, the
                weight is shifted, the balance of all the structure is changed
                and it has to be robust enough to stay together. And, if your
                propulsion system is in the shuttle craft attached to the hub,
                that single spoke has to withstand incredibly strong forces.
                Moreover, if those shuttles are your escape pods, you want to
                have more than one access tunnel to reach them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then you have the boxy versions of R2D2, those two silly robots.
                Towards the end, when Cooper boards one of the shuttles with the
                robot in the back seat, it was just like Luke Skywalker and R2D2
                boarding their tie fighter. They did away with C3PO by giving it
                some funny lines in the script.
              </p>
              <p>
                At one point, one of the robots manipulates, literally; it uses
                a grip at the end of an arm, to do some maneuver by handling a
                joystick designed for a human hand. It seems that amongst the
                very many technologies lost to humanity in those days was
                Bluetooth. I mean, really, does a quite capable robot need
                actual physical manipulators to interact with the fly-by-wire
                system that controls the craft?
              </p>
              <p>
                And why should it? If the computer in a former battle-capable
                robot, designed for robustness, mobility and, one would expect,
                lightness and low power consumption can do all the things it
                does in the movie, is it possible that nobody thought about
                adding some computing power to the craft itself, where none of
                those onerous restrictions apply?
              </p>
              <p>
                Then we have the coded messages (sorry to be ambiguous, I don’t
                want to make a spoiler). How does anybody know it is a message
                at all? I remember from the days of Carl Sagan’s Cosmos that any
                civilization trying to communicate with an unknown intelligence
                would probably start any message with some sort of otherwise
                improbable sequence so that we do know that there is a message
                there. Sagan suggested the first few prime numbers, 1, 2, 3, 5,
                7, 11, 13, 17 and so on. Because if you don’t have that leading
                information, you can’t even know there is a message in there. It
                would be like looking for shapes in the clouds, anything goes.
              </p>
              <p>And a last ones, which include spoilers:</p>
              <p>
                Spoiler: When the station is partially destroyed, it would end
                up unbalanced, much like a washing machine in the spin cycle
                when clothes are all on one side. The central hub where they
                attempt to dock would not simply spin fast or otherwise, it
                would wobble all over the place, drawing, in the best of cases,
                epicyclic curves. That is, of course, if the module where the
                single, vulnerable spoke joins the rim isn’t the one damaged.
              </p>
              <p>
                Spoiler: if they were able to launch self contained space
                habitats for enough people to make it a viable population, why
                bother looking for a planet at all? Spare the cost of the
                propulsion system and fuel and build more habitats and save more
                people! How did they manage to keep whatever was destroying
                Earth from damaging the crops in those habitats? How did they
                manage to put together the resources to build those habitats in
                an otherwise technophobic society which rewrites history books
                to ignore earlier technological advances.
              </p>
