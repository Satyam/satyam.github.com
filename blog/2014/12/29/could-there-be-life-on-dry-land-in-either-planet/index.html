              <p>
                On Earth, it is assumed that life started in the water, after
                all, we do most chemical reactions in some liquid solution or
                other because it allows molecules to move about, meet each other
                and react.  Water, being the most abundant solvent, is the best
                candidate to be the medium where the chemical reactions that
                lead to life started.
              </p>
              <p>
                Initial life forms were drifters, that is, the currents, waves,
                tides and storms were the ones that moved them from one place to
                another, including dry land.  Populating dry land requires
                several abilities. As an organism it needs to survive.  As a
                species, it needs to reproduce. Each of these requirements can
                be broken down into further abilities which would be very hard
                to acquire all at once.
              </p>
              <p>
                Out of the mechanisms that transport drifters, tides are the
                only one that happens with predictable regularity.  Any living
                water organism thrown on dry land by a storm  is, most likely,
                doomed.  Unless it somehow developed while still in the water
                the means not only to survive but to reproduce, its unexpected
                fall on dry land is the end of the story for its genetic line.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tides are the only mechanism that provide a means for drifting
                water organisms to experience living in a dry environment and
                return to the water to reproduce and pass on the traits that
                allowed it to survive.  As the process is repeated over and
                over, more and more abilities can be acquired and passed on to
                later generations until reproduction itself can happen on a dry
                environment.  On Earth, some species like frogs have never
                developed the ability to reproduce on dry land.  Others either
                provide a wet environment, be it external such as an egg or
                internal like mammals, where the new organism can develop.
              </p>
              <p>
                Can life prosper on land in either of the planets in the novel?
                 Mother and Heaven face each other showing the very same face
                much like the Moon does to Earth but in their case, the effect
                is mutual.  This is called gravitational or tidal locking. <a
                  title="Wikipedia: tidal locking"
                  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking"
                  target="_blank"
                  rel="noopener noreferrer"
                  >Wikipedia</a
                >
                has a good explanation for the process. When a body is
                gravitationally locked to another, it has almost no tides.  It
                would still have small tides from its sun but they would be
                irrelevant to our discussion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, could have land life prospered in Mother and Heaven?  It
                might but, admittedly, the chances would have been much smaller.
                 Gravitational locking is a process that occurs over a long time
                and is not simultaneous, the smaller body falls first to the
                influence of its larger neighbor.   Life might have settled dry
                land on the larger planet while it wasn’t still locked to its
                neighbor.  Life might also develop along rivers that grow and
                fade with rain.  Most tropical areas on Earth have wet seasons
                when rain falls regularly every afternoon as the atmosphere
                cools down and cannot hold that much water vapour in it.  These
                showers are not as reliable as tides, but they might serve.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, it might be less likely than on Earth, but life on either
                Mother on Heaven cannot be ruled out.
              </p>
              <p>
                As I mentioned in the afterword, initially I thought the planets
                might have been populated by space travelers, hibernation being
                a trait genetically introduced on the original travelers to
                withstand the long travel times. Over time, the sleeping pattern
                adapted to the day/night cycle of Heaven and Mother, but that
                seemed a pointless and much abused story line so I dropped it.
