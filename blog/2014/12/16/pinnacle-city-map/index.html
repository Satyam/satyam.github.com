                Perhaps I should have drawn this map before starting the novel
                but I did it a couple of days ago. The place changed as the
                action demanded so it would have required me to keep changing it
                so I prefered to keep it in my mind instead of grabbing the
                pencil. Now, since the novel is published, the map is not going
                to change anymore, so I did it.

                It shows just a section of the city. I coloured the water blue,
                some parks green, the city blocks grey, the railroad s<span
                  class="text_exposed_show"
                  >tation red, the Great Temple pink. The city extends well
                  beyond what is shown in this page but, since no action takes
                  place there, I didn’t bother. The only part missing here is
                  Cape Farsi (chapter 12) which would be further to the right
                  along the Promenade.</span

                  Pinnacle is the peninsula at the bottom. The Observatory would
                  be the black circle on the road spiralling up on the fake
                  hill. The Great Temple is the large pink building with the
                  esplanade in front of it, surrounded by other buildings. After
                  the main gate, the causeway leads to the roundabout when it
                  crosses the Promenade and then the big Boulevard of Elvar the
                  Peacifier. To its left is the old city, recognizable by its
                  twisted random streets and then the basin, the port for the
                  river barges. Some non-square city blocks remained on the
                  right hand side of the boulevard which were also part of the
                  old city. The boulevard had actually cut through the old town
                  and new buildings were build facing it, but parts of the old
                  city remain in the back streets.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The sea port is on the left of Pinnacle and a set of locks
                  connects it to the basin. Railroad tracks for cargo run along
                  both the basin, on the far left side, and along the main piers
                  of the sea port. The buildings in that area are mostly
                  warehouses.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Elvar Blvd. ends in the secondary canal, which turns inland
                  somewhere beyond the right edge of this map. The main canal
                  comes from the top left corner which goes past a last set of
                  locks before crossing under the railroad tracks and then
                  entering the basin.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Perhaps the area in between the secondary canal and the
                  railroad station should not have square blocks. It didn’t
                  matter to the story and I felt it was good enough like this.
                  The city would continue on the other side of the railroad
                  station and the tracks, but I didn’t quite bother. Also,
                  beyond the locks on the upper-left corner, branches of the
                  canal should spread into the suburbs and later into the
                  farmland.
