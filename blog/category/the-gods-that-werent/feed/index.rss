However, a novel later developed into a series comes to my mind, The Magic Goes Away by Larry Niven. Though it is still quite unrealistic, it does [&#8230;]]]></description></item><item><title>The Science Behind Science-Fiction</title><link>http://www.satyam.com.ar/blog/2015/03/02/the-science-behind-science-fiction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Mar 2015 18:16:53 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Satyam</dc:creator><category>The Gods that Weren't</category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.satyam.com.ar/blog/2015/03/02/the-science-behind-science-fiction/</guid><description><![CDATA[Browsing through a bunch of old papers I found a few notes on a technology which I meant to use in some novel but dropped it because it wasn&#8217;t feasible.  Now, you might be wondering, we are talking fantasy, right?  What could possibly not be feasible? Well, the point is, we are not talking fantasy, [&#8230;]]]></description></item><item><title>Earlier non-personal computing</title><link>http://www.satyam.com.ar/blog/2015/02/15/earlier-non-personal-computing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2015 18:28:14 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Satyam</dc:creator><category>The Gods that Weren't</category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.satyam.com.ar/blog/2015/02/15/earlier-non-personal-computing/</guid><description><![CDATA[Due to some articles I wrote here and there, I get questions about old computers.  I am no expert in the subject, I just happened to be there while all these happened.  A couple of weeks ago someone told me she heard about a mechanical word processor and asked me to confirm they existed.  As [&#8230;]]]></description></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mother&#8217;s ecology]]></title><link>http://www.satyam.com.ar/blog/2015/01/25/mothers-ecology/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2015 17:44:57 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Satyam</dc:creator><category>The Gods that Weren't</category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.satyam.com.ar/blog/2015/01/25/mothers-ecology/</guid><description><![CDATA[I was tempted to make some mention to Mother&#8217;s ecology but in the end I gave up. I wanted to provide clues as to the origin of Mother of which I will say no more to give away the story.  The problem was how to say it without comparing it to Earth&#8217;s own ecology because [&#8230;]]]></description></item><item><title>Map of Mother</title><link>http://www.satyam.com.ar/blog/2015/01/06/map-of-mother/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2015 16:03:03 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Satyam</dc:creator><category>The Gods that Weren't</category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.satyam.com.ar/blog/2015/01/06/map-of-mother/</guid><description><![CDATA[I had never managed to make a good picture of Mother in my mind.  In the end, it didn&#8217;t really matter, but I always felt there was something missing and inconsistent.  I knew there had to be coast at and around 0º latitude, 0º longitude or, in Mother&#8217;s terms, &#8216;0 grads fall&#8217;, and that there [&#8230;]]]></description></item><item><title>Could there be life on dry land in either planet?</title><link>http://www.satyam.com.ar/blog/2014/12/29/could-there-be-life-on-dry-land-in-either-planet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2014 16:54:51 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Satyam</dc:creator><category>The Gods that Weren't</category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.satyam.com.ar/blog/2014/12/29/could-there-be-life-on-dry-land-in-either-planet/</guid><description><![CDATA[On Earth, it is assumed that life started in the water, after all, we do most chemical reactions in some liquid solution or other because it allows molecules to move about, meet each other and react.  Water, being the most abundant solvent, is the best candidate to be the medium where the chemical reactions that [&#8230;]]]></description></item><item><title>Pinnacle City map</title><link>http://www.satyam.com.ar/blog/2014/12/16/pinnacle-city-map/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2014 18:39:33 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Satyam</dc:creator><category>The Gods that Weren't</category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.satyam.com.ar/blog/2014/12/16/pinnacle-city-map/</guid><description><![CDATA[Perhaps I should have drawn this map before starting the novel but I did it a couple of days ago. The place changed as the action demanded so it would have required me to keep changing it so I prefered to keep it in my mind instead of grabbing the pencil.

Their inhabitants, both man and beast, have adapted to that cycle by hibernating during the night. However, would this be really possible for humans or, in general, for viviparous mammals?
