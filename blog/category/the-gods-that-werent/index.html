                I wrote about what makes fantasy different from science-fiction.
                 Fantasy is limitless, it is magical, science-fiction has
                restrictions, limits and constraints just as real life.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, a novel later developed into a series comes to my mind,
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Goes_Away"
                  >The Magic Goes Away</a
                > by Larry Niven. Though it is still quite unrealistic, it does
                have one important feature of a science-fiction novel, magic is
                becoming scarce because it has been overused. This restriction
                places this novel just a little bit away from pure fantasy, not
                anything can just happen on a whim, there are rules and limits,
                in this case a limited quantity.  Then you avoid  issues like
                the omnipotence paradox: can an omnipotent being create a wall
                it cannot break through?

                Browsing through a bunch of old papers I found a few notes on a
                technology which I meant to use in some novel but dropped it
                because it wasn’t feasible.  Now, you might be wondering, we are
                talking fantasy, right?  What could possibly not be feasible?
                Well, the point is, we are not talking fantasy, we are talking
                science-fiction and though it is fiction, it is not magic, it
                still has to be possible.

                >, I get questions about old computers.  I am no expert in the
                subject, I just happened to be there while all these happened.
                 A couple of weeks ago someone told me she heard about a
                mechanical word processor and asked me to confirm they existed.
                 As it turned out, I could; in fact, I say so in the first of
                those articles, but provided her with some more details.
              </p>
              <p>
                What younger people usually have problem understanding is the
                way in which computers were used only a few decades ago.  Now we
                have so many computer devices, smart phones, tablets, laptops
                and so on, that we need to keep our data in the cloud to make it
                accessible from all those platforms.  Not long ago, having one
                computer per person was a luxury.  Even personal computers were
                able to have multiple users with their separate logins so as to
                share them amongst the family members.  The latests operating
                systems don’t even have the ability to switch users because
                devices are no longer shared.
              </p>
              <p>
                Computing power has become so cheap that we often have
                truckloads of processing power idling around us. Decades ago,
                computers were too expensive to be idle.  You even had several
                shifts of highly qualified operators attending a single machine
                working for a whole organization. Even us, programmers, wrote
                code in paper forms that would later be keypunched to be run at
                some scheduled time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Earlier machines were too expensive to have an operator sitting
                idle in front of it deciding whether this sentence or that
                paragraph looks good, as I am doing right now with this
                sentence.   You idled in front of a piece of paper, edited with
                your pencil, cut and pasted with scissors and glue.  Most people
                didn’t know how to type on a keyboard, it was a highly
                specialized tasks because there was no going back.  Even using
                correcting fluid (most people nowadays don’t even know what that
                is) took time.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, a mechanical word processor would not allow you to do much
                editing, its purpose was to automate the task of actually
                printing hundreds of standard letters. If the letters were in
                the thousands, such as bills for utilities or bank balances, the
                organization would have your mainframe computer to do that.  But
                what if you had a small/medium business?  Then having your own
                automated printing system could be affordable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Going even earlier in time, we have those very early
                one-of-a-kind computers, those that had individual names, which
                were not even called computers, their names all ended in ‘AC’
                (Eniac, Edsac, Maniac, Illiac and so on) for “automatic
                calculator”.   Kids often see Babbage’s Engine and wonder how
                can they ask it a question.  Perhaps they think you write it in
                a piece of paper, insert it into some sort of mailbox, turn the
                handle twice and out pops a card with the answer. Perhaps you
                have to intone the proper enchantment.
              </p>
              <p>
                The purpose of any of those earlier automatic calculators was to
                print tables, in fact, books of tables, to be distributed
                amongst ship captains, artillery officers, radio operators,
                train station chiefs or bank managers.  They didn’t answer
                general questions, they printed answers for a whole range of
                initial values for a very specific problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, when writing this novel and deciding on which user-level
                technology from Heaven to bring into Mother, I was careful to
                avoid, say, a smart phone or tablet.  As Arthur C. Clarke said,
                “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from
                magic”. Thus I decided on a phone network. Behind the scenes it
                is an advanced, cellular network, but with its functionality
                limited to what the initial users would be able to comprehend.
                 A few physical buttons, no screen, just like an old touch-tone
                phone.  The communication equipment would have the ability to do
                much more, but it could have created adverse reactions should
                all of it was to be dumped on regular people all at once.   Let
                the pioneers amongst those in Mother make the system grow.  Even
                the visionaries have their limitations due to their backgrounds.
                They would advance the technology but only within what they can
                understand due to their shared cultural background. All at their
                own pace.

                I was tempted to make some mention to Mother’s ecology but in
                the end I gave up. I wanted to provide clues as to the origin of
                Mother of which I will say no more to give away the story.  The
                problem was how to say it without comparing it to Earth’s own
                ecology because in that world, Earth is not known to exist thus,
                to be self-consistent, the novel cannot make such comparisons.

                I had never managed to make a good picture of Mother in my mind.
                 In the end, it didn’t really matter, but I always felt there
                was something missing and inconsistent.  I knew there had to be
                coast at and around 0º latitude, 0º longitude or, in Mother’s
                terms, ‘0 grads fall’, and that there is where Pinnacle should
                be, however, I never made my mind whether the sea should be to
                the north of Pinnacle City or to the south and, mostly, I
                imagined the coastline running east to west but why should it be
                so, why couldn’t it run north to south or any other direction in
                between?

                On Earth, it is assumed that life started in the water, after
                all, we do most chemical reactions in some liquid solution or
                other because it allows molecules to move about, meet each other
                and react.  Water, being the most abundant solvent, is the best
                candidate to be the medium where the chemical reactions that
                lead to life started.
              </p>
              <p>
                Initial life forms were drifters, that is, the currents, waves,
                tides and storms were the ones that moved them from one place to
                another, including dry land.  Populating dry land requires
                several abilities. As an organism it needs to survive.  As a
                species, it needs to reproduce. Each of these requirements can
                be broken down into further abilities which would be very hard
                to acquire all at once.
              </p>
              <p>
                Out of the mechanisms that transport drifters, tides are the
                only one that happens with predictable regularity.  Any living
                water organism thrown on dry land by a storm  is, most likely,
                doomed.  Unless it somehow developed while still in the water
                the means not only to survive but to reproduce, its unexpected
                fall on dry land is the end of the story for its genetic line.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tides are the only mechanism that provide a means for drifting
                water organisms to experience living in a dry environment and
                return to the water to reproduce and pass on the traits that
                allowed it to survive.  As the process is repeated over and
                over, more and more abilities can be acquired and passed on to
                later generations until reproduction itself can happen on a dry
                environment.  On Earth, some species like frogs have never
                developed the ability to reproduce on dry land.  Others either
                provide a wet environment, be it external such as an egg or
                internal like mammals, where the new organism can develop.
              </p>
              <p>
                Can life prosper on land in either of the planets in the novel?
                 Mother and Heaven face each other showing the very same face
                much like the Moon does to Earth but in their case, the effect
                is mutual.  This is called gravitational or tidal locking. <a
                  title="Wikipedia: tidal locking"
                  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking"
                  target="_blank"
                  rel="noopener noreferrer"
                  >Wikipedia</a
                >
                has a good explanation for the process. When a body is
                gravitationally locked to another, it has almost no tides.  It
                would still have small tides from its sun but they would be
                irrelevant to our discussion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, could have land life prospered in Mother and Heaven?  It
                might but, admittedly, the chances would have been much smaller.
                 Gravitational locking is a process that occurs over a long time
                and is not simultaneous, the smaller body falls first to the
                influence of its larger neighbor.   Life might have settled dry
                land on the larger planet while it wasn’t still locked to its
                neighbor.  Life might also develop along rivers that grow and
                fade with rain.  Most tropical areas on Earth have wet seasons
                when rain falls regularly every afternoon as the atmosphere
                cools down and cannot hold that much water vapour in it.  These
                showers are not as reliable as tides, but they might serve.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, it might be less likely than on Earth, but life on either
                Mother on Heaven cannot be ruled out.
              </p>
              <p>
                As I mentioned in the afterword, initially I thought the planets
                might have been populated by space travelers, hibernation being
                a trait genetically introduced on the original travelers to
                withstand the long travel times. Over time, the sleeping pattern
                adapted to the day/night cycle of Heaven and Mother, but that
                seemed a pointless and much abused story line so I dropped it.

                Perhaps I should have drawn this map before starting the novel
                but I did it a couple of days ago. The place changed as the
                action demanded so it would have required me to keep changing it
                so I prefered to keep it in my mind instead of grabbing the
                pencil. Now, since the novel is published, the map is not going
                to change anymore, so I did it.

                It shows just a section of the city. I coloured the water blue,
                some parks green, the city blocks grey, the railroad s<span

                  beyond what is shown in this page but, since no action takes
                  place there, I didn’t bother. The only part missing here is
                  Cape Farsi (chapter 12) which would be further to the right
                  along the Promenade.</span

                  Pinnacle is the peninsula at the bottom. The Observatory would
                  be the black circle on the road spiralling up on the fake
                  hill. The Great Temple is the large pink building with the
                  esplanade in front of it, surrounded by other buildings. After
                  the main gate, the causeway leads to the roundabout when it
                  crosses the Promenade and then the big Boulevard of Elvar the
                  Peacifier. To its left is the old city, recognizable by its
                  twisted random streets and then the basin, the port for the
                  river barges. Some non-square city blocks remained on the
                  right hand side of the boulevard which were also part of the
                  old city. The boulevard had actually cut through the old town
                  and new buildings were build facing it, but parts of the old
                  city remain in the back streets.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The sea port is on the left of Pinnacle and a set of locks
                  connects it to the basin. Railroad tracks for cargo run along
                  both the basin, on the far left side, and along the main piers
                  of the sea port. The buildings in that area are mostly
                  warehouses.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Elvar Blvd. ends in the secondary canal, which turns inland
                  somewhere beyond the right edge of this map. The main canal
                  comes from the top left corner which goes past a last set of
                  locks before crossing under the railroad tracks and then
                  entering the basin.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Perhaps the area in between the secondary canal and the
                  railroad station should not have square blocks. It didn’t
                  matter to the story and I felt it was good enough like this.
                  The city would continue on the other side of the railroad
                  station and the tracks, but I didn’t quite bother. Also,
                  beyond the locks on the upper-left corner, branches of the
                  canal should spread into the suburbs and later into the
                  farmland.

                Having pods speeding down the ribbon towards either planet is no
                joke. What if anything fails?
              </p>
              <p>
                On Earth, something falling from the moon towards the Earth
                would reach the atmosphere at close to 40 thousand kilometers
                per hour. That was the speed the Apollo capsules had when they
                reached the atmosphere where they slowed down by friction. That
                is why the recent test flight of the new NASA capsule Orion was
                such a big deal, could the thermal shield protect the capsule?
                Since Apollo 17, no spacecraft has re-entered the atmosphere at
                such speed. Orion hasn’t gone that fast, but it was far faster
                than any man-rated vehicle has since Apollo.
              </p>
              <p>
                Anyway, back to the novel, what to do with a failing falling
                pad? If the problem is detected soon enough, the best is to
                discard it. The two halves of the climber, one on each side of
                the ribbon, would simply separate and fall away. The easiest and
                lightest would be explosive bolts, frequently used when
                separating rocket stages, which would also provide a light push
                to each half away from the ribbon. From the midway point up to a
                certain height, the halves would eventually burn up in the
                atmosphere. It would help if the cargo bay opens and the
                contents spread, since that would ensure everything burns up
                faster. However, if this is done very high, the remains might
                get into orbit. That is not good since in that case, they would
                eventually return to the point where they had detached from the
                cable and hit it. That is in theory, in practice, it’s anyone’s
                guess. Due to many perturbation factors, the chances of actually
                hitting the cable are small.
              </p>
              <p>
                The highest chance would be if the two halves are ejected in the
                direction of the ecliptic, meaning one eastwards, the other
                westwards. Even then, the cable is continuously vibrating like a
                guitar string, very slowly, but enough to move away from the
                debris at the right moment. By tensioning the cable or changing
                the speed on the remaining pods, that movement can be adjusted
                to avoid the debris. If ejected in a polar direction, the cable
                and the pod remains would meet only after very many orbits, that
                is, if the pods don’t slow down due to friction in the
                atmosphere and burn down before that happens, which is the whole
                point.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the linear induction motor works all the way down and the
                parachutes fail, an extra set of parachutes could be sent up via
                a small sounding rocket or a weather balloon tethered to the
                cable. As the pod comes down, it would entangle itself in the
                tether and pull the parachute out of the rocket or balloon.
              </p>
              <p>
                An idea that fascinated me was what if that is not enough. I
                remembered how the catapult of an aircraft carrier is stopped
                after it has released the plane. The piston runs in a tube which
                has injectors for water jets that swirl around the inside of the
                tube. The jets point towards the incoming piston but at an angle
                so the water remains attached to the tube, being centrifuged by
                its own speed. The front end of the piston is shaped so it
                scrapes the water from the tube and sends it back through the
                center of the tube. The tube is open towards the bow of the
                aircraft carrier so after every plane departs, the catapult
                spits a jet of water right behind it.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, in the case of the ribbon, two water jets could be sent
                upwards one on each face of the ribbon. The pod would have its
                front shaped like a snowplow. Scraping the water from the ribbon
                and sending it sideways or, preferably, back down, would eat up
                a lot of the speed. Remember that this would only be used if the
                induction motor did work so the pod would be falling at a few
                hundred kph, not tens of thousands. At that kind of speed, the
                pod would not go fast enough to burn in the atmosphere if
                released. For the final stop, a net can be deployed at the top
                of Pinnacle or its counterpart in Heaven, like those deployed in
                aircraft carriers to catch plans whose landing hook is damaged.
              </p>
              <p>
                I would have loved to put this in the novel but it seemed it
                would lengthen that chapter too much. It is already dense with
                technical details, it didn’t need any more.

                Eduardo Longoni, a very smart guy I’ve been lucky to work with,
                was well-known amongst amateur radio operators. When an
                opportunity came up for them to design and launch an amateur
                radio relay satellite he was quite excited. I was surprised to
                find that his main area of interest in that project was heat. I
                knew heat in space was an issue, but I didn’t quite think it was
                something to get so excited about.
              </p>
              <p>
                Perhaps it is thanks to him that I’ve been somewhat careful to
                explai<span class="text_exposed_show"
                  >n how pods would deal with heat. After all, any large
                  electrical motor does produce heat, they even have fins to
                  keep them cool. In space, there is no air for a fan to move
                  about. In the space elevator, the electrical motor is part on
                  the pod itself and the other part is the ribbon, were
                  electrical currents are induced, which might warm up
                  dangerously to the point of melting or even burning. After
                  all, any object at such a height above the surface of a planet
                  does have a lot of potential energy and, if you want it to
                  come to rest at the planet surface, all that energy has to go
                  somewhere.</span
                >
              </p>
              <div class="text_exposed_show">
                <p>
                  So, that is why I devoted a few sentences to explaining how
                  the heat would be dealt with and how it imposed serious
                  limitations on the speed of the pods.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What I have been not so keen to talk about was about
                  vibration. After all, those long ribbons are like guitar
                  strings ready to be plucked. If vibration gets out of hand,
                  bad things happen, like in the famous Tacoma Narrows bridge,
                  but I admit I don’t know enough to even discuss the subject.
                  My guess is that by carefully spacing the pods, probably not
                  at regular intervals, controlling their acceleration and
                  braking so as not to make stationary waves and adjusting the
                  tension on the cable itself, excessive vibration can be
                  controlled, but I really don’t know that much about that.

                The worlds in the novel have very long days, much like our Moon
                does, about two weeks daylight, two weeks nighttime. Their
                inhabitants, both man and beast, have adapted to that cycle by
                hibernating during the night. However, would this be really
                possible for humans or, in general, for viviparous mammals? It
                should be Ok for adults but what about babies?
              </p>

                Babies would have to be born early in the day, which should not
                be much of an issue. When the baby is ready, actual del<span

                  the day/night cycle would be to generate those hormones.
                  During their first day babies would need to grow and gain
                  enough weight during that first daylight period to survive
                  their first hibernation. Maternities would have a really hard
                  job early every morning, with all expecting mothers due on
                  that day giving birth to their child almost all at once. The
                  later in the day a baby was born, the less likely he would
                  survive.</span

                  I didn’t think making our characters too alien would add much
                  to the story, thus I made them very, very human. However, I
                  never said they weren’t born from eggs.
