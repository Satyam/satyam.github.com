              <p>
                On Earth, it is assumed that life started in the water, after
                all, we do most chemical reactions in some liquid solution or
                other because it allows molecules to move about, meet each other
                and react.  Water, being the most abundant solvent, is the best
                candidate to be the medium where the chemical reactions that
                lead to life started.
              </p>
              <p>
                Initial life forms were drifters, that is, the currents, waves,
                tides and storms were the ones that moved them from one place to
                another, including dry land.  Populating dry land requires
                several abilities. As an organism it needs to survive.  As a
                species, it needs to reproduce. Each of these requirements can
                be broken down into further abilities which would be very hard
                to acquire all at once.
              </p>
              <p>
                Out of the mechanisms that transport drifters, tides are the
                only one that happens with predictable regularity.  Any living
                water organism thrown on dry land by a storm  is, most likely,
                doomed.  Unless it somehow developed while still in the water
                the means not only to survive but to reproduce, its unexpected
                fall on dry land is the end of the story for its genetic line.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tides are the only mechanism that provide a means for drifting
                water organisms to experience living in a dry environment and
                return to the water to reproduce and pass on the traits that
                allowed it to survive.  As the process is repeated over and
                over, more and more abilities can be acquired and passed on to
                later generations until reproduction itself can happen on a dry
                environment.  On Earth, some species like frogs have never
                developed the ability to reproduce on dry land.  Others either
                provide a wet environment, be it external such as an egg or
                internal like mammals, where the new organism can develop.
              </p>
              <p>
                Can life prosper on land in either of the planets in the novel?
                 Mother and Heaven face each other showing the very same face
                much like the Moon does to Earth but in their case, the effect
                is mutual.  This is called gravitational or tidal locking. <a
                  title="Wikipedia: tidal locking"
                  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking"
                  target="_blank"
                  rel="noopener noreferrer"
                  >Wikipedia</a
                >
                has a good explanation for the process. When a body is
                gravitationally locked to another, it has almost no tides.  It
                would still have small tides from its sun but they would be
                irrelevant to our discussion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, could have land life prospered in Mother and Heaven?  It
                might but, admittedly, the chances would have been much smaller.
                 Gravitational locking is a process that occurs over a long time
                and is not simultaneous, the smaller body falls first to the
                influence of its larger neighbor.   Life might have settled dry
                land on the larger planet while it wasn’t still locked to its
                neighbor.  Life might also develop along rivers that grow and
                fade with rain.  Most tropical areas on Earth have wet seasons
                when rain falls regularly every afternoon as the atmosphere
                cools down and cannot hold that much water vapour in it.  These
                showers are not as reliable as tides, but they might serve.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, it might be less likely than on Earth, but life on either
                Mother on Heaven cannot be ruled out.
              </p>
              <p>
                As I mentioned in the afterword, initially I thought the planets
                might have been populated by space travelers, hibernation being
                a trait genetically introduced on the original travelers to
                withstand the long travel times. Over time, the sleeping pattern
                adapted to the day/night cycle of Heaven and Mother, but that
                seemed a pointless and much abused story line so I dropped it.

                Perhaps I should have drawn this map before starting the novel
                but I did it a couple of days ago. The place changed as the
                action demanded so it would have required me to keep changing it
                so I prefered to keep it in my mind instead of grabbing the
                pencil. Now, since the novel is published, the map is not going
                to change anymore, so I did it.

                It shows just a section of the city. I coloured the water blue,
                some parks green, the city blocks grey, the railroad s<span
                  class="text_exposed_show"
                  >tation red, the Great Temple pink. The city extends well
                  beyond what is shown in this page but, since no action takes
                  place there, I didn’t bother. The only part missing here is
                  Cape Farsi (chapter 12) which would be further to the right
                  along the Promenade.</span

                  Pinnacle is the peninsula at the bottom. The Observatory would
                  be the black circle on the road spiralling up on the fake
                  hill. The Great Temple is the large pink building with the
                  esplanade in front of it, surrounded by other buildings. After
                  the main gate, the causeway leads to the roundabout when it
                  crosses the Promenade and then the big Boulevard of Elvar the
                  Peacifier. To its left is the old city, recognizable by its
                  twisted random streets and then the basin, the port for the
                  river barges. Some non-square city blocks remained on the
                  right hand side of the boulevard which were also part of the
                  old city. The boulevard had actually cut through the old town
                  and new buildings were build facing it, but parts of the old
                  city remain in the back streets.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The sea port is on the left of Pinnacle and a set of locks
                  connects it to the basin. Railroad tracks for cargo run along
                  both the basin, on the far left side, and along the main piers
                  of the sea port. The buildings in that area are mostly
                  warehouses.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Elvar Blvd. ends in the secondary canal, which turns inland
                  somewhere beyond the right edge of this map. The main canal
                  comes from the top left corner which goes past a last set of
                  locks before crossing under the railroad tracks and then
                  entering the basin.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Perhaps the area in between the secondary canal and the
                  railroad station should not have square blocks. It didn’t
                  matter to the story and I felt it was good enough like this.
                  The city would continue on the other side of the railroad
                  station and the tracks, but I didn’t quite bother. Also,
                  beyond the locks on the upper-left corner, branches of the
                  canal should spread into the suburbs and later into the
                  farmland.

                Having pods speeding down the ribbon towards either planet is no
                joke. What if anything fails?
              </p>
              <p>
                On Earth, something falling from the moon towards the Earth
                would reach the atmosphere at close to 40 thousand kilometers
                per hour. That was the speed the Apollo capsules had when they
                reached the atmosphere where they slowed down by friction. That
                is why the recent test flight of the new NASA capsule Orion was
                such a big deal, could the thermal shield protect the capsule?
                Since Apollo 17, no spacecraft has re-entered the atmosphere at
                such speed. Orion hasn’t gone that fast, but it was far faster
                than any man-rated vehicle has since Apollo.
              </p>
              <p>
                Anyway, back to the novel, what to do with a failing falling
                pad? If the problem is detected soon enough, the best is to
                discard it. The two halves of the climber, one on each side of
                the ribbon, would simply separate and fall away. The easiest and
                lightest would be explosive bolts, frequently used when
                separating rocket stages, which would also provide a light push
                to each half away from the ribbon. From the midway point up to a
                certain height, the halves would eventually burn up in the
                atmosphere. It would help if the cargo bay opens and the
                contents spread, since that would ensure everything burns up
                faster. However, if this is done very high, the remains might
                get into orbit. That is not good since in that case, they would
                eventually return to the point where they had detached from the
                cable and hit it. That is in theory, in practice, it’s anyone’s
                guess. Due to many perturbation factors, the chances of actually
                hitting the cable are small.
              </p>
              <p>
                The highest chance would be if the two halves are ejected in the
                direction of the ecliptic, meaning one eastwards, the other
                westwards. Even then, the cable is continuously vibrating like a
                guitar string, very slowly, but enough to move away from the
                debris at the right moment. By tensioning the cable or changing
                the speed on the remaining pods, that movement can be adjusted
                to avoid the debris. If ejected in a polar direction, the cable
                and the pod remains would meet only after very many orbits, that
                is, if the pods don’t slow down due to friction in the
                atmosphere and burn down before that happens, which is the whole
                point.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the linear induction motor works all the way down and the
                parachutes fail, an extra set of parachutes could be sent up via
                a small sounding rocket or a weather balloon tethered to the
                cable. As the pod comes down, it would entangle itself in the
                tether and pull the parachute out of the rocket or balloon.
              </p>
              <p>
                An idea that fascinated me was what if that is not enough. I
                remembered how the catapult of an aircraft carrier is stopped
                after it has released the plane. The piston runs in a tube which
                has injectors for water jets that swirl around the inside of the
                tube. The jets point towards the incoming piston but at an angle
                so the water remains attached to the tube, being centrifuged by
                its own speed. The front end of the piston is shaped so it
                scrapes the water from the tube and sends it back through the
                center of the tube. The tube is open towards the bow of the
                aircraft carrier so after every plane departs, the catapult
                spits a jet of water right behind it.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, in the case of the ribbon, two water jets could be sent
                upwards one on each face of the ribbon. The pod would have its
                front shaped like a snowplow. Scraping the water from the ribbon
                and sending it sideways or, preferably, back down, would eat up
                a lot of the speed. Remember that this would only be used if the
                induction motor did work so the pod would be falling at a few
                hundred kph, not tens of thousands. At that kind of speed, the
                pod would not go fast enough to burn in the atmosphere if
                released. For the final stop, a net can be deployed at the top
                of Pinnacle or its counterpart in Heaven, like those deployed in
                aircraft carriers to catch plans whose landing hook is damaged.
              </p>
              <p>
                I would have loved to put this in the novel but it seemed it
                would lengthen that chapter too much. It is already dense with
                technical details, it didn’t need any more.

                Eduardo Longoni, a very smart guy I’ve been lucky to work with,
                was well-known amongst amateur radio operators. When an
                opportunity came up for them to design and launch an amateur
                radio relay satellite he was quite excited. I was surprised to
                find that his main area of interest in that project was heat. I
                knew heat in space was an issue, but I didn’t quite think it was
                something to get so excited about.
              </p>
              <p>
                Perhaps it is thanks to him that I’ve been somewhat careful to
                explai<span class="text_exposed_show"
                  >n how pods would deal with heat. After all, any large
                  electrical motor does produce heat, they even have fins to
                  keep them cool. In space, there is no air for a fan to move
                  about. In the space elevator, the electrical motor is part on
                  the pod itself and the other part is the ribbon, were
                  electrical currents are induced, which might warm up
                  dangerously to the point of melting or even burning. After
                  all, any object at such a height above the surface of a planet
                  does have a lot of potential energy and, if you want it to
                  come to rest at the planet surface, all that energy has to go
                  somewhere.</span
                >
              </p>
              <div class="text_exposed_show">
                <p>
                  So, that is why I devoted a few sentences to explaining how
                  the heat would be dealt with and how it imposed serious
                  limitations on the speed of the pods.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What I have been not so keen to talk about was about
                  vibration. After all, those long ribbons are like guitar
                  strings ready to be plucked. If vibration gets out of hand,
                  bad things happen, like in the famous Tacoma Narrows bridge,
                  but I admit I don’t know enough to even discuss the subject.
                  My guess is that by carefully spacing the pods, probably not
                  at regular intervals, controlling their acceleration and
                  braking so as not to make stationary waves and adjusting the
                  tension on the cable itself, excessive vibration can be
                  controlled, but I really don’t know that much about that.

                The worlds in the novel have very long days, much like our Moon
                does, about two weeks daylight, two weeks nighttime. Their
                inhabitants, both man and beast, have adapted to that cycle by
                hibernating during the night. However, would this be really
                possible for humans or, in general, for viviparous mammals? It

                  During their first day babies would need to grow and gain
                  enough weight during that first daylight period to survive
                  their first hibernation. Maternities would have a really hard
                  job early every morning, with all expecting mothers due on
                  that day giving birth to their child almost all at once. The

                I didn’t like Interstellar, the recent SciFi movie. I admit that
                for a hard SciFi fan who likes more nuts and bolts, not dragons
                and melodramatics, all the talk about love being such a force of
                nature, all those long scenes with lots of tears and sorrow were
                a little too much but, well, I am sure it is suitable for a part
                of the audience. Lets accept that.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, what I do expect of a story is self-consistency. I
                tried very hard to be consistent within my novel, I re-wrote
                several parts to be consistent and I get really disappointed
                when I see such a ballyhooed movie fail so badly.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ve all seen small spaceships landing and taking off from
                planets such as tie fighters in Star Wars or shuttle craft in
                Star Trek. Interstellar has its own version of these, however,
                why did they need something that looked pretty much like a
                Saturn V for their first jump into space to join the rest of
                their ship which was already assembled in orbit? Either their
                craft can or cannot raise from planets with a similar gravity
                pull as Earth, either they need a Saturn V or they don’t.
              </p>
              <p>
                They take 2 years to travel from Earth to Saturn via Mars, which
                is a reasonable time with current technology. However, once
                across the wormhole and in another galaxy, they are able to jump
                in between planets in different star systems in less than a
                lifetime. Are the stars in that other galaxy packed so close
                together that they allow travel in between them so fast?
                Because, if they are, it would probably be a chaotic place,
                dangerous and full of radiation from so many celestial bodies
                around hurtling big rocks at each other. Our star is a mild one
                located in a quiet spot on our galaxy. If you are looking for a
                safe place for humanity to live forever, you would hardly look
                at a place where too many star systems are packed so dangerously
                close together.
              </p>
              <p>
                And why does it need to be in some other galaxy? If you can
                travel fast enough to go in between star systems, why not go to
                other star systems within our own neighborhood, in this same
                galaxy.
              </p>

                When they first reach orbit and are about to dock to the station
                everyone except, fortunately, for the pilot, jumps off their
                seats excited like children, to watch the show, at the worst
                possible moment to do so. Whenever a plane lands both passengers
                and crew must be seated with their seat belts adjusted but in
                Interstellar, frolicking around the cabin is normal procedure
                for docking.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then, there is the scene where they stop the craft from spinning
                just because. As far as can be seen, only 2 of the crew of four
                are there present. And so, without warning anybody or,
                aparently, without any prior preparation, the pilot fires the
                attitude rockets to stop the spin. I hope that nobody was frying
                some eggs in the galley at that point or peeing.
              </p>
              <p>
                The station was a very bad design. That ring with a single spoke
                was absurd. Imagine you had a bike with a wheel like that, with
                a single spoke. It can be done but, then, you know it is going
                to be a very heavy wheel because it has to be very robust to
                transmit all the forces around the rim and through that single
                spoke to the hub. A spinning space station is subject to the
                same principles. Whenever the crew meets in one place, the
                weight is shifted, the balance of all the structure is changed
                and it has to be robust enough to stay together. And, if your
                propulsion system is in the shuttle craft attached to the hub,
                that single spoke has to withstand incredibly strong forces.
                Moreover, if those shuttles are your escape pods, you want to
                have more than one access tunnel to reach them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then you have the boxy versions of R2D2, those two silly robots.
                Towards the end, when Cooper boards one of the shuttles with the
                robot in the back seat, it was just like Luke Skywalker and R2D2
                boarding their tie fighter. They did away with C3PO by giving it
                some funny lines in the script.
              </p>
              <p>
                At one point, one of the robots manipulates, literally; it uses
                a grip at the end of an arm, to do some maneuver by handling a
                joystick designed for a human hand. It seems that amongst the
                very many technologies lost to humanity in those days was
                Bluetooth. I mean, really, does a quite capable robot need
                actual physical manipulators to interact with the fly-by-wire
                system that controls the craft?
              </p>
              <p>
                And why should it? If the computer in a former battle-capable
                robot, designed for robustness, mobility and, one would expect,
                lightness and low power consumption can do all the things it
                does in the movie, is it possible that nobody thought about
                adding some computing power to the craft itself, where none of
                those onerous restrictions apply?
              </p>
              <p>
                Then we have the coded messages (sorry to be ambiguous, I don’t
                want to make a spoiler). How does anybody know it is a message
                at all? I remember from the days of Carl Sagan’s Cosmos that any
                civilization trying to communicate with an unknown intelligence
                would probably start any message with some sort of otherwise
                improbable sequence so that we do know that there is a message
                there. Sagan suggested the first few prime numbers, 1, 2, 3, 5,
                7, 11, 13, 17 and so on. Because if you don’t have that leading
                information, you can’t even know there is a message in there. It
                would be like looking for shapes in the clouds, anything goes.
              </p>
              <p>And a last ones, which include spoilers:</p>
              <p>
                Spoiler: When the station is partially destroyed, it would end
                up unbalanced, much like a washing machine in the spin cycle
                when clothes are all on one side. The central hub where they
                attempt to dock would not simply spin fast or otherwise, it
                would wobble all over the place, drawing, in the best of cases,
                epicyclic curves. That is, of course, if the module where the
                single, vulnerable spoke joins the rim isn’t the one damaged.
              </p>
              <p>
                Spoiler: if they were able to launch self contained space
                habitats for enough people to make it a viable population, why
                bother looking for a planet at all? Spare the cost of the
                propulsion system and fuel and build more habitats and save more
                people! How did they manage to keep whatever was destroying
                Earth from damaging the crops in those habitats? How did they
                manage to put together the resources to build those habitats in
                an otherwise technophobic society which rewrites history books
                to ignore earlier technological advances.

                “Initially the ribbons were curved in gentle spirals around the
                center but as they spread, they straightened out. The outer tips
                of each ribbon were tied to the tips of its neighbors which
                forced the ribbons to turn and lay all flat facing the sun.”

                Deployment of a solar array is easy when you assume a flexible
                super-strong material as in the novel, but it can also be done
                if you have rigid solar cells as shown here:  <iframe

                “The bridge was an elegant slender structure made in concrete
                but was covered with the typical red brick of the region for
                decoration.”
              </p>
              <p>
                When I wrote this I was thinking of this bridge, the new one in
                the background, in Albi, France where red bricks are used
                profusely. The foreground bridge is the original one, the one in
                the background (only one arch is visible in between the trees)
                is the modern one, build in concrete and covered in red brick
                just to match the surrounding area.

                is what I had in mind when I described Banglion’s downtown area,
                with the pool for the barges and the railroad station.
              </p>
              <p>
                Banglion would be newly build and the pool larger with a couple
                of footbridges crossing both over the pool and the railroad
                yard.
