<h1>China</h1>

<p>Red Guards, rationing and food coupons, badly fitting gray
clothes, that is something that you won't find in nowadays China.
I visited the People's Republic of China, Mainland China or the
big, real China, however you want to refer to it, during
September 1996, and I was amazed at what I saw. </p>

<p>This, of course, is a personal view, afforded by the fact that
I have I don't know how many megabytes of space for a WEB page
and I got into an inexpensive group tour, $2000 for 13 days, all,
absolutely everything included, so, this is my personal view. </p>

<h1>The People </h1>

        a fourth of the word population lives there. Shanghai is
        the largest city and it has 13 million inhabitants. Not
        so bad, actually, Buenos Aires has 12 million for a
        country of 33 million, so more than a third of the
        country lives in one place. This means that China
        population, though bigger, is far more distributed, which
        is good. There is still about 75% to 80% of the people
        living in rural areas. Current liberalization and the
        possibility of being self-employed, is bringing more and
        more people to the cities, which will spell trouble in
        the long run. </td>

        bellies there. Kids dress really colorful. People dress
        in about any style you can think of, it seems all
        fashions coexist. Panty hoses seem not to exist, women
        wear their silks either ankle length (even with short
        skirts) or just above the length of their skirts, which
        shows the edge when they bike. </td>

        specific, we ate nothing but Chinese food, which means
        that, though the food was as good and as bad as you will
        find elsewhere, we got a little tired, so we started to
        make fun about it. They eat lots of deep fried anything.
        They fry a lot, which would be bad if they didn't also
        steam a lot. Vegetables and rice mostly, some meat of any
        kind. In the free markets, you could see all sorts of
        things swimming and walking and crawling in plastic tubs.
        I didn't ask what I ate. After visiting the free market,
        I felt it was better not to even try to guess. It was
        like the Navy: if it moves, you salute; if it stays
        still, you paint it; if it is warm, you eat it. I didn't
        have to salute any of the food, at least not at my table.

        <p>A place called California Restaurant offered Chinese
        food but with less oil and better presentation, and they
        also brewed beer in the same place, just like in some
        places in California. </p>
        <p>We were offered far more meat than they usually eat.
        Meat is not lean, chicken and duck was with a nice layer
        of fat in between the skin and the meat. Meat is chopped
        randomly into small pieces. It turns out to be difficult
        to access the meat in between the bone and the fat when
        you are holding it with your chopsticks. Oily and fatty
        as it is, you are unlikely to try with your fingers since
        napkins seem to be scarce. One guy described a dish
        brought to the table as &quot;deep fried breaded
        fat&quot;. </p>
        <p>Steamed rice is abundant, though they serve it last,
        since they serve the lesser dishes last, and rice is just
        the filler. Sometimes we asked to speed up the rice so we
        could soak some of the oil. They don't put soy sauce on
        the rice. </p>
        <p>They don't bake. They steam even the bread, which
        comes out as foamy as regular baked bread, but white and
        certainly not crunchy. </p>
        <p>Recent additions to their diet came from McDonalds,
        Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut, and Hagen Dazs for
        dessert. </p>
        <p>On the last day of the tour, our homesickness was
        obvious as we enjoyed burgers and fries at the Hard Rock
        Caf&eacute; in Beijing. My kingdom for a lasagna! </p>

        which, in fact, was exactly the case. Big towns have
        street names in 'pinyan' which is the phonetic
        transcription in roman characters, otherwise, everything
        is in ideograms. Even if someone gave you directions,
        like, go to street this or that, you wouldn't be able to
        recognize the name. <p>Unfortunately, they have chosen
        English phonetics for their transliteration, they even
        call them English characters instead or Roman. Problem is
        that intonation plays a big role in their language. Most
        words are one or two syllables, and they differ by the
        change in pitch. The example they always give is MA,
        which has different meanings in the four intonations they
        use, rising pitch, level, up and down and down. Using
        diacritical marks, like the French do, would have suited
        them nicely so they would be able to differentiate, for
        example, Ma from M&aacute; from M&acirc; from M&agrave;. </p>

        <td>Computers don't help much with the writing due to the
        ambiguities in the transcription. They use the regular
        English keyboard and they type the phonetics of the
        character. After two, three or four keystrokes, the
        program offers, at the bottom of the screen, a choice of
        the characters that match the sound you typed, then you
        select from that. The people I saw typing had to stop
        every two to four characters to make the final selection
        from the options offered. I really couldn't see how you
        could be proficient with that system since the final list
        is almost random, it is not related to the language
        itself but an arbitrary convention adopted by the
        programmer. Part of the ambiguity comes from the lack of
        the diacritical marks as mentioned above and a lot also
        comes because English phonetics is also terribly
        ambiguous, as the words 'though' and 'thought' shows (the
        pronunciation of the first consonant depends on the very
        last letter). This forces them to add letters to further
        identify the correct sound. </td>

        Pinyan, which requires the user to know the sound for
        each character, meaning, basically, you have to know
        Chinese. The other is to know the root symbols. Every
        symbol is composed of other basic ones plus some more
        strokes. If you break up the symbol into its
        constituents, you can find the character under its root.
        Problem is, how you know what the root is under such a
        mix of characters plus binding strokes. Once again, you

        <td>One child per family is the rule, and it seems it
        really works that way in cities. Actually, it is one
        birth per family, so twins or triplets are fine. Couples
        cannot marry until 21 or 22 (don't remember) and they are
        rewarded if they take their time until having their
        child. A second birth takes away all the benefits and you
        have to pay fines, plus possibly loosing your job. This
        is valid only for Han people, who are the ethnic
        majority, with almost 90% of the population. Other ethnic
        groups are allowed complete freedom. <p>Kids enjoy the
        most loving and caring parents you can imagine. You could
        see all over how much attention was devoted to the little
        ones. </p>
        <p>Since usually both parents work, grandparents take
        care of the children. This is further helped by their
        tradition, that keeps families together, (three
        generations usually live under one roof) and their little
        mobility: changing jobs or moving to other cities is too
        new to them, so grandparents are always at hand. </p>
        <p>Farmers can have a second try if the first is a girl,
        since farming is really labor intensive and the
        responsibilities at the farm are still pretty much
        divided by sex. We saw a larger proportion of boys in
        villages, far larger than this policy would justify.
        Actually, if you make the numbers, the second try has as
        much probability of getting a boy as the first so the
        ratio of boys to girls should still be about one to one.
        The difference is that it allows for &frac34; of the families
        to have at least 1 boy in the family. Where are the
        missing girls? Unfortunately, we didn't like the few
        possible answers to that question, so we didn't ask. </p>
        <p>In the city, though, it didn't seem to be any
        preference for boys or girls, we found women in the most
        varied jobs. It was a female junior officer in charge of
        changing guards at Tiennamen Square when we were there. </p>

        Dictatorships usually prevent foreign news from reaching

        openness have brought a more steady and fast growth that
        they could think of. Tiennamen Square doesn't seem to be
        more than a bump in the road. </p>
        <p>Lots of power is in the hands of what formerly where
        communes and now are townships and villages. Since they
        can freely dispose of whatever excedents they make from
        their production, they have money to spend, and they are
        proud to spend it in schools for their most beloved
        single children and recreational facilities for their
        revered elders. Thus, communal centers are a very
        frequent investment, with kindergartens for kids and
        craftsmanship classes for senior citizens. Moreover, some
        of them are able to sell their crafts further increasing

        <td>We visited lots of palaces and temples. The Summer
        Palace in Beijing, though, had an important difference,
        the setting. It is built in between a hill and a lake,
        which allows for lots of different perspectives. Most of
        the other places are built in flat areas and they are
        built as one walled rectangular courtyard within another,
        with the main building(s) in the center. This one is
        spilled on the hillside, overlooking a big lake, with
        several structures built all over the coast. <p>It is
        also nice since it is open to the public and there are
        lots of local people (and I mean lots at a Chinese scale)
        enjoying the place and the boat rides, so the whole place
        is quite alive. </p>
        <p>On the other side of the hill, though the trails
        winding around are very quiet and relaxing. </p>
        <p>We actually started the tour going the wrong way. I
        think we followed a large group which we later figured
        out were employees going for lunch, so we started at the
        back, going over those nice quiet trails. When we got to
        the top, we started going down the other side, towards
        the lake. We crossed a gate and, suddenly, at the other
        side of the wall that shielded us from it, all the noise
        from zillion voices down below hit us. Ouch! </p>
        <p>Still, it was really beautiful </p>

<p>Well, this is it, so far, but I'll keep adding to it. Pictures
will go in as soon as I find someone with a color scanner.
Please, feel free to <a href="mailto:Satyam@Infoasis.com">comment</a>,
just remember, this is not meant to be a profound and thorough
study of China. I didn't see a representative nor random sample
of China, and the little I did see, I saw it from my own
perspective.<br>
</p>

<p>If you ask me if it was worth it, I definitely say YES!!!!! </p>
