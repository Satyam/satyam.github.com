    <h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

    <p>
      As a programmer, I find myself doing more and more programs that generate
      output in HTML or XML (in the following, I'll use XML as a generic term
      for any flavor of HTML and XML itself). None of the languages I use (or
      know of) are quite adapted to producing this kind of output. For most
      programming languages, XML is just a stream of arbitrary characters going
      to the standard output. This made it possible to adopt XML quite fast
      since all that was required from our programs was to output plain
      characters, but in doing so we miss a lot. For all a program cares, the
      XML output is just an arbitrary string, its structure is completely
      ignored. It shouldn't be so.
    </p>

    <p>
      XML is a structured language. So are our programs. Both have strict syntax
      rules. Program translators (compilers or interpreters) take care of
      checking the syntax of programming languages, but it is up to us to check
      the syntax of the XML they produce, a most error prone and tiring task.
      Fortunately, most of us don't even output any XML at all, we either
      configure ready-made packages, tie together modules and components, use
      template engines or occasionally use the DOM to manipulate the tree.
      Nevertheless, at one point or another some part of this whole package does
      have to produce some sort of XML. Most open source packages such as CMSs,
      picture galleries, wikis do not rely on any runtime support, neither
      runtime libraries nor template engines since such dependencies would
      reduce their portability; they produce XML directly. Yes, lots of XML is
      still produced directly and there has to be a way to do it better.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, we have two well structured languages, one is procedural (any flavor
      of C, JavaScript, PHP, Perl, etc.), the other descriptive. Their blocks
      are quite compatible: to start with, they nest nicely within each other.
      If an XML block is contained within an <code> if()</code> block, it has to
      be completely within it, the boundaries of their blocks should not
      overlap.
    </p>

    <p>
      Code is usually embedded into XML via processing instructions like in PHP
      <code> &lt;?php ....?&gt;</code> or other markings, such as
      <code> &lt;% ... %&gt;</code> in ASP or as plain text within an element,
      such as <code> &lt;script&gt;</code>. Nevertheless since most languages
      have <code>print</code> or <code>echo</code> instructions to output
      arbitrary strings to the XML stream, no structure can be forced into such
      a program and, to my knowledge, no code beautifier or highlighter can
      manage to make sense of this, they can either pretty print the code or the
      XML but not both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, other environments such as XML Stylesheets have processing
      instructions embedded as XML elements, but it is quite cumbersome, just
      the namespace prefix xsl: or whatever you choose in front of every
      instruction adds too much typing and the necessary use of attributes to
      hold instruction arguments, explicitly naming each option, as if you
      didn't know that the natural argument to a while instruction is a
      conditional, makes COBOL's verbosity look not so bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, I looked at the problem the other way around, I added XML-specific
      instructions into an existing language. I called those instructions
      <code>TAG</code> and <code> ATTRIBUTE</code> and, since I find no pleasure
      in hitting more keys than absolutely required, I decided to shorten them
      to a couple of symbols: <code> &lt;</code> for <code> TAG</code> and
      <code> @</code> for <code><b>AT</b>TRIBUTE</code>. I was working with PHP
      at the time and the <code> @</code> sign was already in use in a manner
      which prevented my particular use, thus I switched to the
      <code> &amp;</code> sign. Both <code> &lt;</code> and
      <code> &amp;</code> are used in PHP, but they are used in ways that a
      parser can tell when it is the native usage and when my extended use. And
      since I was daydreaming, I opted to use the <code> ?</code> sign as a
      synonym for <code>print</code> or <code>echo</code> but with a twist:
      since XML tags are already output via the <code>TAG</code> statement, the
      output of <code>?</code> will be escaped.
