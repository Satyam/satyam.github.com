    <h1>Spanish for English-speakers</h1>
    <p>
      Many teachers of Spanish trouble their students with the difference in
      pronunciation in between C, S and Z and other such subtleties. This is
      quite unnecessary. All over the Spanish-speaking world, many regional
      accents live together and we all communicate quite effectively. Once upon
      a time, French was the common international language of the learned elite
      until the French themselves became the worst proselytizers of their
      language with their requiring that you either pronounce it with absolute
      perfection or return to the god-forsaken hole you came from.
      English-speakers are far more tolerant and so are Spanish-speakers, though
      not, it seems, the teachers of the language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spanish is a phonetic language, words are pronounced as written following
      a few simple rules. Let's start with vowels. For English speakers, the
      best rule on how they sound is to put a P in front and a T behind. The
      vowel sounds of the English words 'pat', 'pet', 'pit', 'pot' and 'put' are
      close enough to the correct Spanish pronunciation as to make them
      understandable. In most cases, the letter Y can be pronounced as an I, the
      exceptions are mostly a matter of regional accents. It is certainly
      pronounced as a Y when at the end of a word, such as Paraguay and it can
      be pronounced as the J in Joe elsewhere, but that is the case in some
      countries and not in others. In the Caribbean, for example, Y and I are
      the same so, sticking with the I sound is, well, sound policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you find two or three vowels together they are pronounced
      individually in sequence, one after the other. Spanish has no such thing
      as intermediate vowel sounds resulting from averaging or merging vowels
      together. When there are two vowels it means two sounds, even if the same
      vowel is repeated. In English you usually put a hyphen like in
      'co-operation'. In Spanish it is just 'cooperación' with no hyphen and you
      do pronounce each of those two Os as if there was one in between. The U,
      though, has some troubles which we'll see later on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consonants B, D, F, K, M, N, P, S, T, V, X, Z they all sound like in
      English, no surprises there. There is no PH or TH in Spanish. W is not on
      the list simply because it does not exist in Spanish so when you find it,
      it is pronounced as in the language of origin of the word. S and Z sound
      different in some regions, not in others. Feel free to use the S sound for
      all of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      C sounds like an S in front of E and I but as a K in front of A, O or U.
      The group CH is actually a separate letter and it is pronounced like in
      Chile or China. Since it is a separate letter (represented by two
      characters but a single letter) it follows the C so you'll find that in
      some phone books, Chavez follows Czernisky since CH follows the very last
      of the occurrences of C.
    </p>
    <p>
      H is silent in Spanish in all circumstances. CH doesn't count since it is
      a single letter and it is mostly a suffix to the C. SH does not exist in
      Spanish so you may pronounce it however the word is pronounced in the
      original language.
    </p>
    <p>
      J sounds like the English words 'has', 'his', ' hole','hue'. J has only
      that sound, no matter what. J is never pronounced like in Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      L sounds like L but then, there is LL, which is formally another
      two-character letter (LL is listed after LZ in the phone book). LL sounds
      close to LI (Spanish I) with a short I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ñ is not an N with a tilde on it, it is a separate letter and, for
      example, the English 'new' sounds exactly like in Spanish the syllable
      'ñu'. So, just like the LL is like an L closely followed by a short I, Ñ
      is like an N followed by a short I.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Spanish a Q will always be followed by a U which is never pronounced.
      Thus, 'que' or 'quien' might as well be written 'ke' or 'kien', the U is
      completely silent. Actually, you will only find the Q always followed by a
      U and then an E or an I. There are no Spanish words with a Q without the U
      (which is silent) and then followed by anything but an E or an I.
    </p>
    <p>
      R has two sounds strong and soft. It sounds strong when it is at the
      beginning of a word or when it is doubled. It sounds soft elsewhere.
      Rodrigo Rato has strong Rs at the beginning of each word and a soft one in
      the middle. To make it sound stronger in the middle of the word you double
      it like 'arroz' or 'ferrocarril'.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, now lets be done with the G. It has two sounds, strong G as in the
      English 'get' or soft as in 'he'. When it is soft, it is almost the same
      sound as the letter J, not quite, but you shouldn't trouble yourself with
      the difference, it is regional.
    </p>
    <p>
      The G sounds soft in front of an E or an I. It sounds strong in front of
      an A or O. If followed by an U, it all depends. If the U is followed by an
      E or an I then the U is silent (just like after a Q) and the G is
      pronounced strong. Thus, in 'Guernica' or 'guitarra', the U is not
      pronounced and the G sounds strong, like in the English 'get'. The group
      GU In front of any other vowel or alone is pronounced normally as in
      Paraguay (yes, that's three individual vowel sounds 'U-A-Y' in sequence),
      agua or gusto.
    </p>
    <p>
      One more thing about the G, it can be followed with an Ü, an U with the
      double dots (umlaut). Then, the U is not silent and it is pronounced:
      Güemes, agüero. It is meant as a way to undo its roll of forcing a G to
      become strong when in front of an I or an E. That is the only occurrence
      of an U with double dots on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, in Spanish there is only the acute accent. The tilde (the curl
      above the N) is not a diacritical mark, the Ñ is a letter on its own and
      there is no grave or circumflex accents at all. The accent only helps in
      locating where in the word to put the stress. The sound of the underlying
      vowel is not changed by the accent, it just marks the syllable to be
      stressed. If you don't find an accent, then there are two possibilities.
      If the word ends with N, S or a vowel, the strong syllable is the previous
      to last. 'bonos', 'andan' or 'roca', they all have the previous to last
      syllable stressed (the first one in all these examples). Otherwise, the
      last syllable is the one stressed: 'andar', 'hacer', 'fatal'. Monosyllabic
      words don't usually carry accent and, as pronunciation goes, the ones that
      do make no difference, there is only one syllable you can stress anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have to read something in Spanish, you might find more comfortable
      transcribing it to something more phonetic. These are the rules:
    </p>
    <p>
      C in front of an E or an I, change to S. In front of an A, O or U, change
      to a K. In front of an H it is a CH like in Chile.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we agree to use the character G only for the strong G sound like in the
      English 'gut' then, when in front of an E or an I, change to J (and
      remember J is soft). GUE or GUI change to G unless the U has the double
      dots, then leave it and pronounce each, the G and the U.
    </p>
    <p>
      Change Y to I, LL to LI, Ñ to NI. QU change to K. Delete H unless part of
      a CH. Double all Rs at the begining of a word, double RRs sound stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the word has no acute accent on it and it ends with N, S or vowel, put
      the acute accent in the previous to last, otherwise put it in the last
      syllable. Then put the stress on the syllable with the accent.
