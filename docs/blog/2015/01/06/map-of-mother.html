 I had never managed to make a good picture of Mother in my mind. In the end,
 it didn´t really matter, but I always felt there was something missing and
 inconsistent. I knew there had to be coast at and around 0º latitude, 0º
 longitude or, in Mother´s terms, `0 grads fall´, and that there is where
 Pinnacle should be, however, I never made my mind whether the sea should be to
 the north of Pinnacle City or to the south and, mostly, I imagined the
 coastline running east to west but why should it be so, why couldn´t it run
 north to south or any other direction in between?" />

  I realized that this is the image of Mother I had been looking for. I feel
  Pinnacle should be somewhere in the large bay enclosed within the main
  fishhook continent. Anywhere there would do, more or less, it doesn´t matter
  that much.
</p>
<p>
  What I liked of this map, which made me realize the misconception I had is
  that the main continent does not need to extend completely to the south or
  completely to the north of Pinnacle. In a few drafts I made early on I had a
  horizontal line for the equator and then one blob of a continent either
  completely above or completely below that equator line. That was it, pretty
  simple but also very artificial and unrealistic. This map shows a far more
  credible distribution of landmasses that I ever imagined as well as various
  features like fertile and arid lands, lakes, rivers and mountains, and still
  works for the purpose of the novel.
</p>
<p>
  Science fiction is always about exploring the edges of the known universe. My
  mental image of Mother was too limited, too simple, very poor, it showed a
  complete lack of imagination. I am happy that this image allowed me to go
  beyond those bounds.
