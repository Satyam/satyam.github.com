              <p>
                What younger people usually have problem understanding is the
                way in which computers were used only a few decades ago.  Now we
                have so many computer devices, smart phones, tablets, laptops
                and so on, that we need to keep our data in the cloud to make it
                accessible from all those platforms.  Not long ago, having one
                computer per person was a luxury.  Even personal computers were
                able to have multiple users with their separate logins so as to
                share them amongst the family members.  The latests operating
                systems don´t even have the ability to switch users because
                devices are no longer shared.
              </p>
              <p>
                Computing power has become so cheap that we often have
                truckloads of processing power idling around us. Decades ago,
                computers were too expensive to be idle.  You even had several
                shifts of highly qualified operators attending a single machine
                working for a whole organization. Even us, programmers, wrote
                code in paper forms that would later be keypunched to be run at
                some scheduled time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Earlier machines were too expensive to have an operator sitting
                idle in front of it deciding whether this sentence or that
                paragraph looks good, as I am doing right now with this
                sentence.   You idled in front of a piece of paper, edited with
                your pencil, cut and pasted with scissors and glue.  Most people
                didn´t know how to type on a keyboard, it was a highly
                specialized tasks because there was no going back.  Even using
                correcting fluid (most people nowadays don´t even know what that
                is) took time.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, a mechanical word processor would not allow you to do much
                editing, its purpose was to automate the task of actually
                printing hundreds of standard letters. If the letters were in
                the thousands, such as bills for utilities or bank balances, the
                organization would have your mainframe computer to do that.  But
                what if you had a small/medium business?  Then having your own
                automated printing system could be affordable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Going even earlier in time, we have those very early
                one-of-a-kind computers, those that had individual names, which
                were not even called computers, their names all ended in `AC´
                (Eniac, Edsac, Maniac, Illiac and so on) for “automatic
                calculator”.   Kids often see Babbage´s Engine and wonder how
                can they ask it a question.  Perhaps they think you write it in
                a piece of paper, insert it into some sort of mailbox, turn the
                handle twice and out pops a card with the answer. Perhaps you
                have to intone the proper enchantment.
              </p>
              <p>
                The purpose of any of those earlier automatic calculators was to
                print tables, in fact, books of tables, to be distributed
                amongst ship captains, artillery officers, radio operators,
                train station chiefs or bank managers.  They didn´t answer
                general questions, they printed answers for a whole range of
                initial values for a very specific problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, when writing this novel and deciding on which user-level
                technology from Heaven to bring into Mother, I was careful to
                avoid, say, a smart phone or tablet.  As Arthur C. Clarke said,
                “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from
                magic”. Thus I decided on a phone network. Behind the scenes it
                is an advanced, cellular network, but with its functionality
                limited to what the initial users would be able to comprehend.
                 A few physical buttons, no screen, just like an old touch-tone
                phone.  The communication equipment would have the ability to do
                much more, but it could have created adverse reactions should
                all of it was to be dumped on regular people all at once.   Let
                the pioneers amongst those in Mother make the system grow.  Even
                the visionaries have their limitations due to their backgrounds.
                They would advance the technology but only within what they can
                understand due to their shared cultural background. All at their
                own pace.
              </p>
