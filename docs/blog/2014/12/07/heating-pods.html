  Eduardo Longoni, a very smart guy I´ve been lucky to work with, was well-known
  amongst amateur radio operators. When an opportunity came up for them to
  design and launch an amateur radio relay satellite he was quite excited. I was
  surprised to find that his main area of interest in that project was heat. I
  knew heat in space was an issue, but I didn´t quite think it was something to
  get so excited about.

  Perhaps it is thanks to him that I´ve been somewhat careful to explain how
  pods would deal with heat. After all, any large electrical motor does produce
  heat, they even have fins to keep them cool. In space, there is no air for a
  fan to move about. In the space elevator, the electrical motor is part on the
  pod itself and the other part is the ribbon, were electrical currents are
  induced, which might warm up dangerously to the point of melting or even
  burning. After all, any object at such a height above the surface of a planet
  does have a lot of potential energy and, if you want it to come to rest at the
  planet surface, all that energy has to go somewhere.
</p>
<p>
  So, that is why I devoted a few sentences to explaining how the heat would be
  dealt with and how it imposed serious limitations on the speed of the pods.
</p>
<p>
  What I have been not so keen to talk about was about vibration. After all,
  those long ribbons are like guitar strings ready to be plucked. If vibration
  gets out of hand, bad things happen, like in the famous Tacoma Narrows bridge,
  but I admit I don´t know enough to even discuss the subject. My guess is that
  by carefully spacing the pods, probably not at regular intervals, controlling
  their acceleration and braking so as not to make stationary waves and
  adjusting the tension on the cable itself, excessive vibration can be
  controlled, but I really don´t know that much about that.
