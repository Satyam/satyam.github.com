 The worlds in the novel have very long days, much like our Moon does, about
 two weeks daylight, two weeks nighttime. Their inhabitants, both man and
 beast, have adapted to that cycle by hibernating during the night. However,
 would this be really possible for humans or, in general, for viviparous
 mammals? It should be Ok for adults but what about babies?

  The worlds in the novel have very long days, much like our Moon does, about
  two weeks daylight, two weeks nighttime. Their inhabitants, both man and
  beast, have adapted to that cycle by hibernating during the night. However,
  would this be really possible for humans or, in general, for viviparous
  mammals? It should be Ok for adults but what about babies?

<p>
  Babies would have to be born early in the day, which should not be much of an
  issue. When the baby is ready, actual delivery is triggered by hormones and
  part of the adjustment to the day/night cycle would be to generate those
  hormones. During their first day babies would need to grow and gain enough
  weight during that first daylight period to survive their first hibernation.
  Maternities would have a really hard job early every morning, with all
  expecting mothers due on that day giving birth to their child almost all at
  once. The later in the day a baby was born, the less likely he would survive.
</p>
<p>Unless, of course, they are neither viviparous nor mammals.</p>
<p>
  I didn´t think making our characters too alien would add much to the story,
  thus I made them very, very human. However, I never said they weren´t born
  from eggs.
