      This is a view from the back of the Engine, a close-up of the carry
      detection mechanism, the green device, that wasn't shown in previous
      animations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The figure wheels to the right are the ones that are about to receive the
      addition, which comes through the magenta sector wheels from the figure
      wheels to the left. Remember, this image is taken from a point completely
      opposite the previous images so everything looks reversed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The carry detector has a curved arm which is almost touching the bottom
      figure wheel to the right. It also has a couple of teeth on the forked arm
      right above the curved one. That is the one that adds the carry to the top
      figure wheel, as will be seen later on. The hammer-like arm in the
      foreground has some notches on the outer face, which engage with a
      detention mechanism, not shown in this image (it would block all view to
      the rest of the mechanism). This d√©tente makes sure the device does not
      fall into intermediate, undetermined positions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The carry detector turns loose around the axis, all angular movement is
      provided externally. It does go up and down with the axle and, at this
      point, it is shown in the position ready to detect the carry from the
      bottom wheel, while the forked teeth above are not yet engaged with the
      top figure wheel.
    </p>

    <p>
      This animation shows the carry detection in action. The carry lever comes
      down until the curved arm is at a height that matches that of the four
      external 'decade' teeth around the figure wheel (not the 40 'units' teeth
      of the main gear). Notice it comes down along the magenta sector wheels.
      There is a short pause. During this pause, the figure wheel restore arm is
      about to engage the inner teeth of the figure wheels in the background to
      the left, as seen in
      <a href="addinga.htm">Adding a Digit</a>. When the restore arm hits the
      inner teeth, the figure wheel in the back starts moving, carrying the
      sector wheel and the foreground figure wheel. Since the background figure
      wheels are in different positions (that is, they represent different
      numbers) they start moving at different points in time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Soon after the bottom figure wheel in the foreground starts moving, the
      outer teeth hits the curved detection arm of the carry lever and turns the
      lever to the 'warned' position.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a little gray part at the bottom right corner of the bottom
      wheel. That is a section of one of several locks that the Engine has, to
      ensure the wheels remain in place while everything around them is moving.
      Notice that while the sector wheels come down, the lock remains engaged
      but it moves aside right before the addition is to happen. The actual lock
      is not a series of small parts, one for each wheel, but a single bar that
      runs the full height of the figure wheels, and locks them all at once.
