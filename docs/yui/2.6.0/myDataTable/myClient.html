				<h1>Customizing YUI Library's DataTable</h1>
			</div>
			<div id="bd">
			</div>
			<div id="ft">
				<p>This is an example on how you can customize a DataTable and the DataSource to work your way. 
				Both have not only existing properties customized but I have also added methods to both.</p>
				<p>Ut is meant as sample file for my articles on the YUI blog on the using the DataTable, <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2008/10/15/datatable-260-part-one/">Part 1</a> and <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2008/10/27/datatable-260-part-two/">Part 2</a>.</p>
				<p>The example is made of this file plus <code>myDataTable.js</code> containing the modified DataTable, <code>myServer.php</code> 
				which handles the back end and <code>ajaxServices.php</code> which handles the back and forth ajax messages
				plus a few icons.  The whole is zipped into <a href="satyamdatatable.zip">satyamdatatable.zip</a> file</p>
				<p>New records can be added by clicking on the <img src="add.png" /> icon, deleted by clicking on the <img src="delete.png" /> icon
				and edited with several in-line editors which pops when clicking on a cell. </p>
				<p>All changes are transmitted to the server and reflected on the DataTable
				only when the server approves.  For example, the server won't accept deleting records which have an even numbered <code>Id</code>. 
				The record insertion combines defaults from the client and some, such as the database table primary key which the
				server sends back to the client.</p>
				<p>Cell editing is possible on most fields with different editors.  All edits are sent and have to be accepted by the server.
				Just to show that the server can say something about such edits, it will turn into uppercase all strings and will always change the 
				<code>Date</code> field to the current date except when the <code>date</code> is the one being edited.</p>
				<p>If you have any tools to monitor the traffic in between the client and the server (in Firebug, the Net tab)
				you will see the exchange of messages in between them. All messages to the server go as POST with the data URL-encoded,
				all replies come within a fixed envelope and can be any of the following:
				    <pre>
// Plain Ok response
{   "replyCode":200, "replyText":"Ok" }

// Ok with extra data
{
    "replyCode":201, "replyText":"Data Follows", 
    "data":[{ ..., ..  } , ... ] 
    // or  "data":{ ..., ... } if only a single record.

}

// Something went wrong
{ "replyCode":500, "replyText":"Something really bad happened" }
</pre>
</p>
				<p>Perhaps the most noticeable effect of this customizing  in the source code in this very page 
					is how short it is.  It is basically an instantiation of my own customized DataTable, 
				called SATYAM.DataTable.  The only arguments provided are the container that will hold it, 
				the columns definition and the optional configuration attributes.  The DataSource is missing but, no worries, 
				it will be there.</p>
				<p>  The columns definitions also have some extra properties:</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>type</dt>
						<dd>It specifies the data type of a column.  This value is the key to a table which defines information about:
						<dl>
							<dt>formatter</dt>
								<dd>It will set the <code>formatter</code> of the column</dd>
							<dt>parser</dt>
								<dd>It will set the <code>parser</code> for this field in the <code>DataSource.responseSchema.fields</code> entry</dd>
							<dt>editor</dt>
								<dd>It will set the <code>editor</code> to the corresponding editor taken from <code>YAHOO.widget.DataTable.Editors</code></dd>
							<dt>editorOptions</dt>
								<dd>Options to be used as arguments in the instantiation of the editor above</dd>
							<dt>stringer</dt>
								<dd>A function to be called to convert the value when concatenating it into the url-encoded message to the server.  
									The value returned will be further url-escaped</dd>
							<dt>cellEditorFormatter</dt>
								<dd>A formatter to be used when showing the value in the cell editor.  For example, the <code>Price</code> column
								which is shown in European style with comma as a decimal separator, needs this to show it with the same decimal
								separator in the textbox editor.  You can also enter the value either with comma or dot as a decimal separator
								but don't use thousands separator, otherwise it will get messed up.</dd>
						</dl>
						The following types are defined:
						<ul>
							<li>number</li>
							<li>currency</li>
							<li>date</li>
							<li>string</li>
						</ul>
						The <code>string</code> value is a catch-all for non-typed columns.
						You can add further type definitions in the <code>SATYAM.DataTable.types</code> hash table.  
						For example, the <code>currency</code> definition uses some of the same properties as <code>number</code>
						except that it uses a formatter with two decimals, thousands separator and a currency sign.
						You can freely add your own field types
						</dd>
					<dt>edit</dt>
						<dd>Since the type of editor comes out of the <code>type</code> above you only need to say whether the column is editable or not</dd>
					<dt>isPrimaryKey</dt>
						<dd>When the client needs to send the data to the server, it has to identify the record it belongs to.  
						The columns (one or more) that contain the values that make the Primary Key of the database table to be identified
						so the client can always send them along any other field that is being modified</dd>
					<dt>noShow</dt>
						<dd>Some fields are not relevant to the user.  By setting <code>noShow</code> the column won't be displayed. 
						The values for this column will still be available in the <code>Record</code> object</dd>
					<dt>defaultValue</dt>
						<dd>When the user inserts a new record into the DataTable, this values will be inserted plus any that the server
						might send.  In this case, the server will always provide the <code>id</code> value since it is the primary key
						of the new record, produced from an auto-increment field, which the client cannot guess in advance</dd>
					<dt>MadeUp</dt>
						<dd>The column is made up in the client side, no data comes from the server, no data is sent to the server
						for these columns</dd>
					<dt>action</dt>
						<dd>Some of the made up columns are intended for the DataTable to execute some actions.  Currently my
						custom DataTable accepts only two actions, <code>insert</code> and <code>delete</code></dd>
				</dl>
				<p>
				The file <code>myDataTable.js</code> contains further comments.  
				The article <a href="http://www.satyam.com.ar/yui/PhpJson.htm">A PHP back end to YUI</a> explains how the
				file <code>ajaxServices.php</code> works and how it is used in <code>myServer.php</code>.  
				This last one lacks access to any database so the database access functions won't work.  All the data is
				generated at random.
