		<h1>Issue with Panels</h1>
		<p>Hello,</p><div id="defined"><p>

I'm a teacher and I'm really just getting into CSS / Javascript, so be
gentle I've only just popped my <span class="definition">cherry</span>.
</p><p>
So far I've successfully figured out a system which allows a given
word within a body of text to both have a tooltip popup box, as well
as a panel pop up for it when clicked.   
</p><p>
My intent is to create a series of webpages that contain assignment
information for students, such as how to complete a project.  The hope
is that I can code this page in such a way that all the 'difficult'
words contain a tooltip with a basic definition, and then have a panel
that will pop up when they are clicked with a much more indepth
definition, including a <span class="definition">pronunciation</span> guide and wave file that when an
Icon is clicked the student can listen to the definition (for those
with disabilities / language issues).
</p><p>
Here are the problems I forsee and would like help with avoiding:
</p><p>
Firstly, through my testing I have discovered that only the first
instance of a particular id within a page will launch my tooltip or
the panel.  This is problematic because though most students will 'get
it' that the first instance is the only clickable one, I would like
all of them to function the same.  I do not feel like coding a whole
bunch of ID's and entries for those ID's to make that work... who would? 
</p><p>
Ive seen some stuff related to groupIDs but at my current level of
understanding I really cant make sense of it.  Can someone explicate
this a bit further for me.  I'm not dumb... I just dont have the
rudiments down.
</p><p>
Secondly, I've done some limited testing to attempt to make it so that
the in-depth glossary entries are not in-line to the page, but rather
that they are external held in .html files in a sub-directory called
/glossary/.  This would be an ideal setup because it would allow me to
link to pages in the glossary directory for the content of my panels
so that I would only need to change those .html files in order to
change content over multiple assignment pages.
</p><p>
The problem I'm facing with this is that my limited CSS / HTML
knowledge doesnt seem to be cutting it.  I attempted using a frame
within the panel to show the content, but it doesnt even show the
content of the referenced html file.
