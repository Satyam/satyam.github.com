<H1>YQL and YQLDataSource</H1>
<P>Yahoo! Query Language, <A HREF="http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/" NAME="YAHOO! Query Language">YQL</A>,
is a great way of accessing an immense amount of information via a
standard easy to use interface. To have a taste of how easy it is,
compare the old <A HREF="http://developer.yahoo.com/music/api_guide/ArtistService.html">Artist
Service documentation </A>with the YQL query: <CODE><A HREF="http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/?q=select%20*%20from%20music.artist.search%20where%20keyword='Rihanna'&amp;_uiFocus=music">select
* from music.artist.search where keyword='Rihanna'.</A></CODE> The
<A HREF="http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/">YQL Console</A> is
very easy to use. It lists many of the tables available and sample
queries on them so you can easily explore the wealth of information
accessible through it. YQL does not store the data, it is a query
interface to other databases or APIs. The number of tables that YQL
lists from Yahoo! sources is 142 but if you click on the <A HREF="http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/?q=show%20tables&amp;env=store://datatables.org/alltableswithkeys">Show
Community Tables</A> link, the count rises to 825 and includes access
to public data on Amazon, Facebook, NetFlix or the New York Times.
Sometimes these tables require an access key you have to obtain from
their owners; without it you may either not be able to perform the
query or you will get a limited number of results. The YQL service
itself has two addresses, one public and another which requires
registration and provides better performance and, of course, you will
need authentication to access private data from some of its tables.</P>
<P>By default, YQL will only provide a sample reply with about 10
records. You can specify a larger number of results by adding the
number requested in parenthesis after the table name, for example:</P>
<PRE>select * from music.artist.search(22) where keyword=&quot;madonna&quot;</PRE><P>
Next to each table name in the Data Tables list in the YQL Console,
whenever you mouse over a table name a <span style="color:white;background-color:grey;font-family:Verdana, sans-serif">&nbsp;Desc&nbsp;</span>
button will show to the right of the table name. That will provide a
description of the table, including a sample queries and a list of
fields where it is very important to check out which of those are
marked as required. There is where you may find required access keys
for certain tables. 
</P>
<P>Some tables are not fit for AutoComplete since they don't provide
results for partial search keys. Though YQL allows for where
conditions such as <CODE>keyword like 'mado%'</CODE>, the actual
provider of the data does not support such queries so as the user
starts typing in the AutoComplete box the name of Madonna, only
results with full word matches will appear and Madonna will not be
offered until it is typed in full.</P>
<P>Sorting in YQL is a filter applied after the result set is
fetched. If you were to use YQL as the source for a DataTable with
server-side sorting and pagination, you are in trouble because if the
user has the table already sorted by a certain column and asks for
page two, YQL will first select the next <I>N</I> records of the
unsorted table and then sort those when you would normally expect the
next <I>N</I> records of the sorted table. Let me explain that, say
you have a table with a single numeric field and the table contains
4,3,2,1 in that order. You have a DataTable with two rows per page
and have it sorted by its single column. YQL will return 3,4 for the
first page and 1,2 for the second, instead of 1,2 and then 3,4. That
is because it first does the 'page' selection on the unsorted data
and then sorts it.</P>
<P>YQL responses change depending on the number of items returned. If
we were to dump the variable pointing to the results, we may get any
of these, depending on the item count:</P>
<TABLE>
	<TR>
		<TH>Count</TH>

<P>The last column shows a more consistent alternative, no whimsical property name and always an array with whatever number of items 
the query might return, but always a simple array.</P>
<P><A NAME="firstHeading"></A>YQL can also provide the very same
information in several formats, <A HREF="http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20*%20from%20geo.places%20where%20text=%22san%20francisco,%20ca%22">XML</A>,
<A HREF="http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20*%20from%20geo.places%20where%20text=%22san%20francisco,%20ca%22&amp;format=json">JSON</A>
and <A HREF="http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20*%20from%20geo.places%20where%20text=%22san%20francisco,%20ca%22&amp;format=json&amp;callback=cbfunc">JSONP</A>,
the later being the one we are most interested in. Due to the
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">Same-Origin
Policy</A>, browsers don't allow their <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest">XMLHttpRequest</A>
object to access sources out of its own domain. <A HREF="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/">YUI's
Connection Manager</A> was affected by this until it introduced its
<A HREF="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/#xdr">interface to
Flash</A> which allows such cross-domain requests, however, just as
there is still IE6 around, not everyone has the latest Flash version
installed.</P>
<P>The <A HREF="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/get/">YUI Get Utility</A>
coupled with YQL's <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP#JSONP" NAME="Wikipedia entry for JSONP">JSONP</A>
capability solves this. Let's see how this works. You can add
<CODE>&lt;script&gt;</CODE> tags at any time and <CODE>&lt;script&gt;</CODE>
tags can load anything from anywhere: we do this regularly when we
load the YUI Library components from Yahoo!'s CDN regardless of where
our page is located. However, this needs some help from the server,
the <CODE>&lt;script&gt;</CODE> tag expects JavaScript code. If we
were to load a file containing the following:</P>
<PRE>123</PRE><P>
it wouldn't help much. The number would be evaluated and then dropped
since it hasn't been assigned to anything or used in any way. If we
were to load this:</P>
<PRE>var result = 123;</PRE><P>
then, the number would be stored into variable <CODE>result</CODE>.
Such a variable would be in the global scope, which is not a good
idea. It has a further issue, though the value would be safely
stored, since the script loads asynchronously, we would not know when
it is finally available. The Get utility helps us because it monitors
the communication and signals both successful and failed
transactions. A more general solution, relying on some help from the
server, is to wrap the value in a function call, like this:</P>
<PRE>callbackFunction(123);</PRE><P>
This function would take care of storing or processing the value and
it would not be called until the content is fully loaded, so it can
also signal the arrival of the data. Most JSONP servers accept an URL
argument, usually called callback which contains the name of the
function to wrap the data with. Namespaced functions such as
<CODE>YAHOO.example.SiteExplorer.callback</CODE> are a far wiser
option for callback functions.</P>
<P>An important issue is to be considered: JSONP is by no means as
secure as JSON. JSON does not allow any sort of executable code in
the field values. Though, in principle, any good JSON encoder should
prevent code from being injected into the JSON output, YUI's <A HREF="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/json/">JSON
utility</A> also checks that none is received. This is not the case
with JSONP where anything received will be happily executed, with all
sorts of possible side-effects, no questions asked. In JSONP, you are
basically asking a foreign server to produce a script to load. Thus,
be careful to use JSONP on trusted servers and if you plan to provide
JSONP from your server, make sure to use a good JSON encoder before
wrapping the results in the callback so that any field that might
contain fraudulent code gets escaped and thus neutralized. Just as we
learned about <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL
Injection</A> and how to prevent it, remember JSONP shares this kind
of <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP#Basic_Security_concerns">vulnerability</A>.
Most techniques to prevent SQL Injection will also prevent JavaScript
Injection.</P>
<P>The YQL service allows for this, when selecting JSON as the output
format, an extra input box shows to the right of the JSON checkbox,
initially containing the text <CODE>cbfunc</CODE>. This is translated
to an extra argument in the URL. The standard response is XML, if we
select JSON, the URL changes from:</P>
<PRE>http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20*%20from%20geo.places%20where%20text%3D%22san%20francisco%2C%20ca%22</PRE><P>
to</P>
<PRE>http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20*%20from%20geo.places%20where%20text%3D%22san%20francisco%2C%20ca%22&amp;format=json&amp;callback=cbfunc</PRE><P>
The basic URL takes a <CODE>q</CODE> argument containing the
URL-encoded query. For JSON we may specify <CODE>format=json</CODE>
and to make it JSONP we provide the name of the <CODE>callback</CODE>
function. An optional <CODE>diagnostics=true</CODE> argument may be
added to get some extra diagnostics information in the response.</P>
<P>The page for the Get utility contains an <A HREF="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/get/get-script-basic.html">example</A>
that uses YQL as the source of data. Jonathan LeBlanc has written a
nice <A HREF="http://github.com/jcleblanc/yql-utilities/tree/master/js-yql-display/">utility</A>
to do YQL queries and format their results based on a simple
template, which he presented in a <A HREF="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2009/06/17/yui-and-yql/">YUI
Blog article</A>. It improves on the simple example in that you just
need to provide the YQL query, the template to format the result and
the container for the result and it takes care of all the minutiae
for us.</P>
<PRE>yqlWidget.push(
   // query
   'select item.description from weather.forecast where location = 90210',  
   // configuration options
   {},
   // template with placeholders with field names inside curly brackets
   '&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;{item.description}',
   // id of the container for the results
   'widgetContainer'
);
yqlWidget.render();</PRE><P>
Any number of fields can be requested and their field names, even
nested fields such as <CODE>item.description</CODE>, can be used in
the template by enclosing them in curly brackets.</P>
<P>The result of a YQL query is usually some tabular information.
YUI's <A HREF="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datasource/">DataSource</A>
component is designed to retrieve this type of information. Several
other YUI components use DataSource to fetch their data,
<A HREF="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/autocomplete/">AutoComplete</A>,
<A HREF="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/charts/">Charts</A> and
<A HREF="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/">DataTable</A> do
so. Some time ago I developed a subclass of DataSource, <A HREF="http://www.satyam.com.ar/yui/2.8.0/YQLDataSource.js">YQLDataSource</A>
that extends <CODE>YAHOO.util.ScriptNodeDataSource</CODE> to connect
to the YQL web service to fetch data from it. I used it in <A HREF="http://www.satyam.com.ar/yui/2.8.0/nested1.html">this
example</A>, where the data for an AutoComplete box and two levels of
nested DataTables are provided by YQLDataSource (the nested
DataTables will be the subject of a further article).</P>
<P>YQLDataSource is very simple and could be simpler still. In the
constructor we simply set the default URL for the YQL web service, if
none is explicitly given by the developer:</P>
<PRE>YAHOO.util.YQLDataSource = function (oLiveData, oConfigs) {
    oLiveData = oLiveData || 'http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?format=json&amp;q=';
    YAHOO.util.YQLDataSource.superclass.constructor.call(this, oLiveData, oConfigs); 
};</PRE><P>
As part of the URL we already establish the format of the reply as
JSON and add the <CODE>q</CODE> argument to receive the YQL query.</P>
<P>Just as all other DataSource subclasses do, we also copy over the
static members, mostly constants, that we can use:</P>
<PRE>YAHOO.lang.augmentObject(YAHOO.util.YQLDataSource, YAHOO.util.DataSourceBase);</PRE><P>
When extending the ScriptNodeDataSource, we override several of its
members, the first of them being the <CODE>responseType</CODE> since
we know it is going to be JSON:</P>
<PRE>YAHOO.lang.extend(YAHOO.util.YQLDataSource, YAHOO.util.ScriptNodeDataSource, {
    responseType:YAHOO.util.DataSource.TYPE_JSON,</PRE><P>
Since we will receive a YQL statement as the request, we need to
escape it before allowing it to be concatenated into the rest of the
URL. We do that in the <CODE>makeConnection</CODE> method, which we
override thus:</P>
<PRE>makeConnection : function(oRequest, oCallback, oCaller) {
    YAHOO.util.YQLDataSource.superclass.makeConnection.call(this,encodeURIComponent(oRequest),oCallback,oCaller);
}</PRE><P>
We simply call the original version with the <CODE>oRequest</CODE>
argument, which contains the YQL query, properly escaped.</P>
<P>Now we add some magic. We'll assume that we've been careful and
explicitly enumerated the fields to retrieve. I really hate those
<CODE>Select *</CODE> statements in production code, they are fine
for exploring but wasteful in an end product. Thus, I'll trust that
whatever fields come in the response are the ones we really wanted.
Unfortunately, YQL does not return a list of fields nor their data
type, moreover, depending on the query, fields such as dates might
show up in very different formats. Since YQL is no more than an
intermediary, the values it returns are those from the original
source in whichever format they are provided, which accounts for the
different formats of values such as dates or Booleans.</P>
<P>So, in the end, we will trust whatever comes in the results but,
if some piece of data is not in the proper format, we'll still allow
a parser to be specified. For example, to sort a column containing
numbers in YUI DataTable, number fields need to be actual JavaScript
numbers, not just strings containing digits. The YQL query for the
tracks of a particular album returns the numeric values as strings,
so we need to parse them into numbers. We can say:</P>
<PRE>var tracksDS = new YQLDS('', {
    responseSchema: {
        fields:[
            {key:'Track.discNumber', parser:'number'}, 
            {key:'Track.trackNumber', parser:'number'},
            {key:'Track.duration', parser:'number'},
            {key:'Track.popularity', parser:'number'}
        ]
    }
});</PRE><P>
The query also contains a <CODE>title</CODE> field, which is a string
and needs no parsing, thus, we don't need to mention it, but it will
be there anyhow. Also note that the data is nested a level further
down so we use dot-notation to fetch it. If the first row of data,
which we use to figure out what fields are coming, is not
representative of the structure of the response, the fields missing
in that first row can be specified as well and, finally, if for some
reason the data is not located where YQLDataSource assumes, we can
also specify the <CODE>resultsList</CODE>. 
</P>
<P>We won't go into the details of how it is done, the source code
contains comments to that effect. Enough to say that the
<CODE>parseJSONData</CODE> method is overridden so, before the
original method is called, all the field information is extracted
from the first row of the data about to be parsed and combined with
whatever the developer has specified. In this method we also add the
<CODE>responseSchema.metaFields </CODE>property, if not already
present, to extract meta-information that is always available on the
query, the number of records returned (<CODE>count</CODE>),when the
result set was created (<CODE>created</CODE>) and the language of the
data (<CODE>lang</CODE>).</P>
<P>For simple cases, I build <A HREF="http://satyam.com.ar/yui/2.8.0/YQLDataSource.html">this
example</A> which uses YQLDataSource and is able to fill a given
container with the results of a query based on a template. The
function can be called like this:</P>
<PRE>YAHOO.example.YQLSubstitute(
    'list',
    'select title, abstract, url, source from search.news where query=&quot;barcelona&quot;',
    '&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;{title}&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;{abstract}&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;address&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{url}&quot;&gt;{source}&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/address&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;'
);</PRE><P>
I called the function <CODE>YQLSubstitute </CODE>and placed it under
the <CODE>YAHOO.example</CODE> namespace. It takes the following
arguments:</P>
<OL>
	<LI>A reference to or the id of the HTML that will contain the
	results, in this case, a reference to a <CODE>&lt;ul id=”list”&gt;</CODE>
	element elsewhere in the page. 
	<LI>The YQL statement to execute 
	<LI>The template with the field names as placeholders 
	<LI><P>An optional configuration object. 
	</P>
</OL>
<P>Since the query is supported by YQLDataSource, it is possible to
use dot-notation to specify nested fields in the placeholders. The
optional fourth argument, the configuration options, is passed
straight through to the YQLDataSource so, if any parser is needed,
they can be set here. Additionally, the <CODE>YQLWebService</CODE>
configuration option lets you override the URL of the YQL web
service.</P>
<P>For YUI3, there are still not many other components that can
consume the data from a DataSource and DataSchema so, for the time
being, I used Dav Glass' <A HREF="http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/yql">YQLQuery</A>
gallery module which will be part of the 3.2.0 release so it might be
out of the gallery by the time you read this. In the <A HREF="http://satyam.com.ar/yui/3.0.0/YQLSubstitute.html">YQLSubstitute</A>
example for YUI3 I tried to provide the same interface as in the YUI2
example, with a few exceptions. The first argument is a CSS3 selector
as is customary in YUI3, nested fields and parsers are not available
and there is no extra configuration option, just the first three
mandatory arguments. Both examples are well commented, just scroll
down to reach after the query output.</P>
