<H2>Row Expansion and Nested DataTables</H2>
<P>This has been an on-going issue for quite some time: the need to
expand the information associated with a row in a DataTable so that
the extra information is shown right below it, usually in the way of
a further DataTable which might also have its rows expandable into
more nested levels. So far there has been several serious attempts at
it. DataTable's own list of examples includes a <A HREF="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/datatable/dt_rowexp_basic.html">Row
Expansion</A> example by Eric Gelinas. John Lindal presented his
<A HREF="http://jafl.github.com/yui2/treeble/">Treeble</A> in a <A HREF="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/04/14/treeble-using-nested-yui-2-datasources-for-row-expansion/">YUI
Blog article</A> some time ago with a <A HREF="http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/treeble">version
for YUI3</A> in the Gallery and I also tried with my <A HREF="http://www.satyam.com.ar/yui/#NestedDataTables">NestedDataTable</A>.</P>
<P>Neither of them is completely satisfactory and the question comes
up again and again, two people asked for it at the <A HREF="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/07/29/ask-satyam/">Ask
Satyam</A> article in the YUI Blog so I'll go again at it picking
some ideas from here and there but first of all, let me explain a
deep design issue in DataTable that makes this request hard to
fulfill. Though it may sound a little depressing at first, there are
solutions to these issues and they don't affect the built-in features
of the DataTable itself (none that I could detect) but some API
methods it offers or their use. You need to know the issues to decide
so, here we go. 
</P>
<H3>A few issues to consider</H3>
<P>DataTable makes a couple of very basic assumptions. One is that
the ordinal position of a Record corresponds to the same ordinal
position of a row within the <CODE>&lt;tbody&gt;</CODE> of the
markup. I count 17 occurrences of property <CODE>sectorRowIndex</CODE>
which returns the ordinal number of a <CODE>&lt;tr&gt;</CODE> element
within its section, that is, the <CODE>&lt;tbody&gt;</CODE>, <CODE>&lt;thead&gt;</CODE>
or <CODE>&lt;tfoot&gt;</CODE> where it is contained. There are also
many occurrences where the ordinal position of the Record is used as
an index into array of rows. For example, in the <A HREF="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/datatable/dt_rowexp_basic_clean.html">Row
Expansion</A> example, let it run to the end, expand any row about
half-way to the table and then, in the debugging console execute the
following two statements:</P>
<PRE>YAHOO.example.Basic.oDT.getTrEl(YAHOO.example.Basic.oDT.getRecord(17)).id 
YAHOO.example.Basic.oDT.get<B>Next</B>TrEl(YAHOO.example.Basic.oDT.getRecord(17)).id </PRE><P>
Both will show <CODE>“yui-rec17”</CODE> as the answer, which is
not correct since the second statement should return the id of the
next row. If you do the same with no rows expanded or using a low
number, before the expanded row, the second statement will correctly
return <CODE>“yui-rec18”</CODE>.</P>
<P>Obviously, all examples listed work as they stand, you have to
trick it to make it fail as with the above statements, and if your
application stays within these safe boundaries, you are fine but a
feature added to your application at a later time may bring the whole
thing tumbling down. DataTable is very robust, its built-in
functionality is pretty safe, it sorts columns, edits cells, selects
and highlights fine, as far as I tested it. I wasn't able to break
its most popular built-in features, but just beware, it may happen.</P>
<P>Nesting things within the DataTable also brings some other issues:
clicking somewhere in an expanded custom row might be troublesome
since the click on the nested element would bubble up to the
containing DataTable where it can mess things up. You must remember
that when listening to events such as <CODE>cellClickEvent</CODE> on
the parent table since the target cell reported might not belong to
the parent table but to a nested one so fetching the Record or Column
for that cell may fail.</P>
<P>Finally, there are some conceptual issues, what does <CODE>getNextTrEl</CODE>
mean? Does it include only DataTable's own rows, lets call them data
rows, or should include custom rows added later, as it does now? I
would say it should only include data rows since the custom rows,
being nested, are not siblings to the data rows but children and,
though the HTML markup forces us to use plain <CODE>&lt;TR&gt;</CODE>
elements, conceptually, they are not siblings. Then, if you somehow
reach a <CODE>&lt;TR&gt;</CODE> element and ask for its corresponding
Record in the containing DataTable using method <CODE>getRecord()</CODE>,
if that <CODE>&lt;TR&gt;</CODE> is a custom row, what would be its
corresponding Record, <CODE>null</CODE> (since it doesn't belong to
the containing DataTable but to the nested one) or the Record of the
data row it is a child of? 
</P>
<P>How do you want the stripes on the rows? Currently, it takes even
and odd rows indiscriminately, whether data rows or custom rows but
perhaps you would like the custom rows to carry on the same
background color as the data row they belong to.</P>
<P>Though this issues need defining, any decision on them, as long as
it is consistent and predictable, would be just fine.</P>
<H3>Nesting without DataTable</H3>
<P>Of course, we might live with this restrictions, but then what is
the point of bothering with the DataTable at all? If all you want is
to display some nested information in a tabular form, just use a
regular <CODE>&lt;table&gt;</CODE> element or something like it. In
fact, the YUI3 version of Treeble does exactly that; since there is
no YUI3 version of DataTable to be used, it uses none at all. You
might as well do the very same thing with YUI2, like in <A HREF="http://satyam.com.ar/yui/2.8.0/RowExpansionPlainHTML.html">this
example</A>, where no DataTable nor HTML <CODE>&lt;table&gt;</CODE>
was used at all. Admittedly, the example is very simple and visually
ugly (I'd never claimed I had good taste) but if that is all you care
for, at least you know it won't fail you. Just an idea you might want
to evaluate when you decide on what to do.</P>
<H3>Row Expansion with DataTable</H3>
<P>Finally, you might really want to use a DataTable so, how do we go
about that? Both Treeble and my own <A HREF="http://satyam.com.ar/yui/2.8.0/nested1.html">NestedDataTable</A>
nest two DataTables. Eric Gelinas, in contrast, has used another
approach, which I find more flexible. He does not make any
assumptions on what is going to be in the expansion. It uses a
<CODE>rowExpansionTemplate</CODE> configuration attribute which can
either take a string template or a reference to a function. The
string template is processed via <CODE>YAHOO.lang.substitute</CODE>
along the data from the Record object for the row about to be
expanded. We know that we don't need to list in the column
definitions array all the fields we have read with the DataSource, we
can keep those extra fields in reserve for later use. This template
mechanism lets us display in the expansion row those other fields we
didn't have space enough in the regular row. The <A HREF="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/datatable/dt_rowexp_basic.html">example</A>
lists picture names from Flickr, images which might be too big to
show in the main DataTable. The fields to assemble the URL pointing
to those pictures are loaded from the start. Upon row expansion,
those bits are put together to built an <CODE>&lt;img&gt;</CODE> tag
and the thumbnail for the picture is shown in the expansion row.</P>
<P>Now, if we set <CODE>rowExpansionTemplate</CODE> to a function
reference, then we get all the flexibility we might possibly want. I
used that idea in <A HREF="http://satyam.com.ar/yui/2.8.0/nestedRowExpansion.html">this
example</A>, but with a somewhat different <A HREF="http://www.satyam.com.ar/yui/2.8.0/rowexpansion.js">rowexpansion.js</A>
file. The original was more focused on using the string template and
it assumed that the expansion row could be destroyed and rebuild at
any time at no cost. That is not the case when the expansion is
something more complex, such as a DataTable with further DataTables
nested within. Every time a column is sorted, DataTable will delete
all rows and start anew, which would be tremendously expensive with
complex content if it was to be deleted and reconstructed as well.
So, what I do is to keep a reference to the expansion row in the
expansion state object (see description in method <CODE><A HREF="http://www.satyam.com.ar/yui/2.8.0/rowExpansionDocs/YAHOO.widget.RowExpansionDataTable.html#method_getExpansionState">getExpansionState</A></CODE>),
which is stored in the Record of the parent table, which is not
deleted, and restore that same row whenever the parent row is
re-rendered. 
</P>
<P>Sometimes, however, the parent rows will be deleted on purpose or
the parent DataTable reloaded from the server with, possibly,
different data which requires the children to be refreshed. I need to
explicitly delete the child rows in such cases because otherwise they
would remain in memory as zombies. Thus, I override several methods
(<CODE>deleteRow</CODE>, <CODE>deleteRows</CODE>, <CODE>initializeTable</CODE>,
<CODE>destroy</CODE>) and delete the nested content before its parent
Record is deleted. Deleting, however, is not enough, since the
content might need some more elaborate means of disposal. As many
complex components, DataTable has a <CODE>destroy</CODE> method which
needs to be called when deleting. I added the
<CODE>rowExpansionDestroyEvent</CODE> event to signal that the nested
row is about to be destroyed, thus allowing the developer to handle
the content as required, for example:</P>
<PRE>albumDT.on('rowExpansionDestroyEvent', function (state) {
    state[NESTED_DT].destroy();
});</PRE><P>
All events receive the <CODE>state</CODE> object as their single
argument. Here, I use the reference to the nested DataTable which I
stored under a property name of my own (constant <CODE>NESTED_DT</CODE>,
declared elsewhere) and call its <CODE>destroy</CODE> method.</P>
<P>RowExpansionDataTable adds the column that triggers row expansion
automatically and also listens to clicks on that column, you don't
need to do anything for that column to show up and be active. It
always adds it on the left hand side by using this simple code in the
constructor:</P>
<PRE>var REDT = function(elContainer,aColumnDefs,oDataSource,oConfigs) {

     aColumnDefs.unshift({
          key:ROW_EXPANSION,
          label:'',
          className:CLASS_TRIGGER
     });
     REDT.superclass.constructor.call(this, elContainer,aColumnDefs,oDataSource,oConfigs); 
};

YAHOO.widget.RowExpansionDataTable = REDT;</PRE><P>
It also sets a listener for <CODE>cellClickEvent</CODE> and checks if
the column clicked is the one with its key set to the value stored in
constant <CODE>ROW_EXPANSION</CODE>, there is no need for us to
respond to that event while it doesn't prevent us to set further
listeners for our own purposes on other columns.</P>
<P>Though the basis of my <A HREF="http://www.satyam.com.ar/yui/2.8.0/rowexpansion.js">rowexpansion.js</A>
file is Eric's, I'm afraid it is hard to run a diff in between them
as it will show too many differences. I changed many of the variable,
method and property names to conform to the standard naming
conventions and fixed plenty of errors flagged by <A HREF="http://www.jslint.com/">JSLint</A>
so diff goes wild. In its basics, the code is still Eric's.</P>
<P>The <A HREF="http://satyam.com.ar/yui/2.8.0/nestedRowExpansion.html">example</A>
is well commented and described after the sample table the
<A HREF="http://www.satyam.com.ar/yui/2.8.0/rowexpansion.js">rowexpansion.js</A>
file is easy to follow and its <A HREF="http://satyam.com.ar/yui/2.8.0/rowExpansionDocs/YAHOO.widget.RowExpansionDataTable.html">API
Docs</A> also available.</P>
<H3>Overlaying children</H3>
<P>Another alternative to adding rows is to make the expansion float
above the parent row. I have used this in my own <A HREF="http://satyam.com.ar/yui/2.8.0/nested1.html">NestedDataTable
example</A>. This example also uses YQL tables via YQLDataSource and,
as I mentioned in the <A HREF="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/08/09/ask-satyam-yql-and-yui/">previous
article</A>, the YQL Artists search table is somewhat clumsy to use
along AutoComplete as it won't bring back matches with partial artist
names.</P>
<P>Here, when you expand a row, a container <CODE>&lt;div&gt;</CODE>
is created and appended to the document body. The container uses
absolute positioning and is moved to overlap the row right below the
one being expanded. The container thus covers the rows next to the
one being expanded so, the height of this row is increased to make
space for the overlapping container. 
</P>
<P>This mechanism spares us from the two issues I mentioned before:
no row is added to the DataTable, the ordinal positions of Records
and Rows match at all times and events can't bubble from the
containers to the DataTable since they are not descendants of the
DataTable. However, keeping up the position of the containers
requires paying attention to several events and recalculating their
position. Sorting the main table with several children open will move
all the containers to their new positions with ease, and so will
resizing the browser window. 
</P>
<P>This <A HREF="http://satyam.com.ar/yui/2.8.0/nested1.html">example</A>
uses just two levels of nesting while the RowExpansionDataTable
example could be expanded to any limit. I have tried to combine the
two and I see no theoretical reason why it would not succeed,
however, in trying to do so I found the example got so complex that
it was hard to describe in a blog article of any reasonable size. The
example, as it is, has complete control over the parent and child
tables, knows when they expand or contract, move, get redrawn or
change in any other way, and can easily access any of them an adjust
their layout. In trying to extend this to any number of levels, I
found that communicating all those changes up and down the hierarchy
of nested components, not all of them necessarily DataTables, was
hard, with changes deep in one branch possibly affecting nested
components on other branches. 
</P>
<P>As I said, the complexity lies not so much in communicating those
changes up and down and acting on them as in trying to provide
standard interfaces for generic child elements to participate. If you
have full control over the several containers and their content, it
should be manageable, but it would only justify doing so if the
RowExpansionDataTable fails in some particular application, as I
admit it may, and cannot be fixed easily.</P>
<H3>Conclusion</H3>
<P>You don't always need real DataTables to have tables nested inside
each other, but if you do, my RowExpansionDataTable is a good choice,
besides being a good example on how to extend DataTable. It has some
issues, which I described so that if you bump into them, you know
where to look and, hopefully be able to work around them. DataTable
itself is amazingly robust and handles quite nicely. Overlapping
content in the DataTable is also a possible solution, if signaling
the changes in size and position of the children can be solved
efficiently, though it is hard to do in a generic component, so I
didn't even try to get into it. Neither did I try a version
inheriting from ScrollingDataTable: it is not that I forgot but that
I know it is not trivial.</P>
