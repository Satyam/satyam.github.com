<H1>A Further Recipe for a YUI3 Widget Component</H1>
<P>As a followup on my previous article on this blog, <A HREF="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2011/04/01/a-recipe-for-a-yui-3-application">A
Recipe for a YUI 3 Application</A>, I decided, first of all, to
change the title a little bit since a true MVC application framework
is on the way so I will simply deal with a component derived from
Widget and an extension I made for it. In my previous article, I
showed a way to use <CODE>Y.substitute</CODE> as a
very basic template processor. The idea went on from there, with
suggestions from everywhere and I made it an extension, available at
my site, called <A HREF="http://satyam.com.ar/yui/3.0.0/makenode/makenode.js">makenode</A>.
MakeNode is not a generic template processor and it is not meant as
one. On the other hand, it is tightly integrated with the YUI Widget
foundation class which is the environment it is meant to work in.
Furthermore, as I kept adding more features, the extension now also
helps with events and internationalization thus rendering the name of
the extension an historical accident. As an example, I will use the
<A HREF="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/examples/widget/widget-extend.html">Spinner</A>
component available as an example of Widget, modified following the
guidelines in my previous article and using MakeNode. The modified Spinner component (
<A HREF="http://satyam.com.ar/yui/3.0.0/spinner/spinner.js">js</A>, 
<A HREF="http://satyam.com.ar/yui/3.0.0/spinner/assets/skins/sam/spinner.css">css</A>, 
<A HREF="http://satyam.com.ar/yui/3.0.0/spinner/assets/skins/sam/arrows.png">sprites</A>)
as well as an <A HREF="http://satyam.com.ar/yui/3.0.0/SpinnerTest.html">example</A>
are available from my site.</P>
<H2>Extending your component</H2>
<P>Once MakeNode is loaded, you need to include the module in your
<CODE>YUI().use()</CODE> statement using the name
<CODE>'makenode'</CODE>. Then, to extend your widget,
you list it in the third argument to <CODE>Y.Base.create()</CODE>,
like this:</P>
<PRE>Y.Spinner = Y.Base.create(
     'Spinner',
     Y.Widget,
     [Y.MakeNode],
     {
        // instance members ...
     },
     {
         // static members
     }
); </PRE><P>
You can add MakeNode along any number of suitable extensions for
Widget, such as WidgetParent, WidgetChild, WidgetStdMode, etc..
MakeNode adds two protected methods, <CODE>_makeNode</CODE>
and <CODE>_locateNodes</CODE> and it will read from
several static properties, if found.</p>
<p>All members of this extension are either protected or private since 
they are meant to be used by the component developer and not by 
the developer using those components who should not be bothered with them.
</P>
<H2>Defining the Template</H2>
<P>The first thing you will normally do is to define the template for
your component. For the Spinner, our template will be:</P>
<PRE>_TEMPLATE: [
    '&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; title=&quot;{s input}&quot; class=&quot;{c input}&quot;&gt;',
    '&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; title=&quot;{s up}&quot; class=&quot;{c up}&quot;&gt;&lt;/button&gt;',
    '&lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; title=&quot;{s down}&quot; class=&quot;{c down}&quot;&gt;&lt;/button&gt;'
].join('\n'),</PRE><P>
The default template will usually be named <CODE>_TEMPLATE</CODE>
and declared along the other static properties of the class, such as
<CODE>ATTRS</CODE>. MakeNode will use this template
if none other is explicitly provided. The template is made of plain
HTML plus a series of placeholders enclosed in curly brackets, each
made of a single character, the processing code, followed by one or
more arguments. The placeholders and what they produce are:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><CODE>{@ attributeName}</CODE> configuration
	attribute value 
	</P>
	<LI><P><CODE>{p propertyName}</CODE> instance
	property value
	</P>
	<LI><P><CODE>{m methodName arg1 arg2 ....}</CODE>
	return value of the given method. The processing code is followed by
	the method name and any number of arguments separated by whitespace.
	Strings must be enclosed in double quotation marks. Numbers,
	Booleans and <CODE>null</CODE> will be converted
	from string to their proper data types</P>
	<LI><P><CODE>{c classNameKey}</CODE> CSS className
	generated from the <CODE>_CLASS_NAMES</CODE> static
	property 
	</P>
	<LI><P><CODE>{s key}</CODE> string from the <CODE>strings</CODE>
	attribute, using <CODE>key</CODE> as the
	sub-attribute.</P>
	<LI><P><CODE>{? </CODE><CODE><I>other
	placeholder</I></CODE><CODE>}</CODE> Produces the
	string <CODE>checked</CODE> when the result of
	processing the rest of the placeholder is true. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><CODE>{}</CODE> any other value will be
	handled just like <CODE>Y.substitute</CODE> does. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>For example, <CODE>{@ value}</CODE> will translate
to <CODE>this.get('value')</CODE> while <CODE>{p
value}</CODE> translates to <CODE>this['value']</CODE>.
</P>
<P>The <CODE>{m}</CODE> placeholder is a little more
complex. The first argument after the <CODE>m</CODE>
processing code is the name of the method  and the rest of the
arguments, all separated by whitespace from each other, will be
passed to the given method. Those arguments can be numbers, <CODE>null</CODE>,
<CODE>true</CODE>, <CODE>false</CODE>
or strings enclosed in double quotes. MakeNode will parse them and
convert them to their proper types, thus <CODE>{m
myMethod 123.45 true "this is a string"}</CODE> will result in
calling <CODE>this.myMethod(123.45, true, "this is
a string")</CODE> so that the first two arguments are converted to
their correct data types and the string at the end can have spaces.
To include a double quote, use <CODE>\\&quot;</CODE>,
the double backslash being required because JavaScript will interpret
a single one and discards it before it gets to MakeNode. Only double
quotes are allowed, MakeNode does not use <CODE>eval()</CODE>
so the parser is limited but safe. Anything but numbers, <CODE>null</CODE>,
Booleans and double quoted strings will be ignored.</P>
<P>The <CODE>{?}</CODE> placeholder is handy to use
with checkboxes and radio buttons. It will produce the string
<CODE>"checked"</CODE> depending on the truth
value of the processing instruction code that follows. Thus, <CODE>&lt;input
type="checkbox" {? m getLength}/&gt;</CODE> will produce a marked
checkbox if the <CODE>getLength</CODE> method returns
anything but zero. <CODE>{?}</CODE> will accept any
of the other placeholders, though it only makes sense with the first
three.</P>
<P>For the <CODE>{c}</CODE> placeholder, we need to
have a <CODE>_CLASS_NAMES</CODE> property defined.</P>
<P>Further placeholders can be added to MakeNode by adding them into
the <CODE>_templateHandlers</CODE> hash.</P>
<H2>The _CLASS_NAMES property</H2>
<P>Along with the <CODE>ATTRS</CODE> and <CODE>_TEMPLATE</CODE>
static attributes, we can define a <CODE>_CLASS_NAMES</CODE>
property which points to an array of strings. Each of those strings
will be used to generate a className. Thus <CODE>_CLASS_NAMES:
['input']</CODE> will produce the className <CODE>"yui3-spinner-input"</CODE>.
Those classNames are stored in an instance property <CODE>this._classNames</CODE>.
The <CODE>{c input}</CODE> placeholder in the
template above will be replaced by <CODE>"yui3-spinner-input"</CODE>.</P>
<P>You can use the <CODE>_CLASS_NAMES</CODE> property
to generate any number of classNames, whether you use them in the
template or not. You can still reach those extra classNames from
within <CODE>this._classNames</CODE>. The className
is generated using the <CODE>yui3</CODE> prefix
followed by the value of the <CODE>NAME</CODE> static
property, turned lowercase and then the string given in <CODE>_CLASS_NAMES</CODE>
(this last one will not be turned lowercase), all separated by
hyphens. The <CODE>_classNames</CODE> hash will also
contain the classNames for the <CODE>boundingBox</CODE>
and the <CODE>contentBox</CODE>, the first under the
<CODE>&quot;.&quot;</CODE> key and the second under
the <CODE>"content"</CODE> key. Widget assigns to
the <CODE>boundingBox</CODE> the classNames derived
from the values of the <CODE>NAME</CODE> property of
each of the classes in the inheritance chain, starting with
<CODE>yui3-widget</CODE>. MakeNode stores into
<CODE>this._classNames</CODE> only the top-most
className for the <CODE>boundingBox</CODE>.</P>
<P>If a component is several levels away from Widget, like
<CODE>SuperSpecialSpinner</CODE> inheriting from
<CODE>SuperSpinner</CODE> which inherits from <CODE>Spinner</CODE>
which inherits from <CODE>Widget</CODE> and if any or
all of them have <CODE>_CLASS_NAMES</CODE> properties
defined, MakeNode will produce classNames for all of them and store
them in <CODE>this._classNames</CODE>. You don't need
to include at each level the names already declared in the previous
levels. In fact, it is better that you don't since the classNames
produced at each level will use the value of the <CODE>NAME</CODE>
property of that level. Thus, in <CODE>SuperSpecialSpinner</CODE>,
<CODE>{c input}</CODE> will still result in
<CODE>"yui3-spinner-input"</CODE> and not
<CODE>"yui3-superspecialspinner-input" </CODE>and
so it will keep your CSS file still valid.</P>
<H2>The {s} placeholder</H2>
<P>Widget has a <CODE>strings</CODE> configuration
attribute defined, though it is not initialized with any value. This
attribute is meant to hold strings that are visible to (or, via
screen readers, read to) the user. It is important that you never
include visible strings directly in the template. This is not a
requirement of MakeNode, it has never been a good idea at all. All
strings that are to be viewed by or read to the user should have
always been placed in the <CODE>strings</CODE>
attribute. The <CODE>strings</CODE> attribute
contains a hash where each individual text is located by its key. The
Spinner component has the following strings, which you can see used
in the template above.</P>
<PRE>strings: {
    value: {
        input: &quot;Press the arrow up/down keys for minor increments, page up/down for major increments.&quot;,
        up: &quot;Increment&quot;,
        down: &quot;Decrement&quot;
    }
},</PRE><P>
The best part of doing this is that your component can be localized
to other languages very easily by developers using your component.
When creating an instance of Spinner, you might do:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">var mySpinner = new Spinner({strings: Y.Intl.get('spinner')});</PRE><P>
Setting the configuration attribute <CODE>strings</CODE>
in this way replaces the hard-coded values in the <CODE>strings</CODE>
attribute already inside the component, which provide a default to
fall back into, with those in the language resource file loaded
elsewhere, using the language previously defined. The <CODE>{s}</CODE>
placeholder accesses the strings stored in the <CODE>strings</CODE>
attribute, either the default ones or the translated ones, if set.
The <CODE>{s xxxx}</CODE> placeholder is, in fact,
nothing more than a shortcut to the <CODE>{@
strings.xxxx}</CODE> placeholder, however, the first can only access
strings at the top level while, for example, <CODE>{@
strings.xxxx.yyyy.zzzz}</CODE> would allow you to access a string
deeper down.</P>
<H2>Using _makeNode in renderUI</H2>
<P>We use the template to create the markup for our component. To do
so, we can call MakeNode's <CODE>_makeNode</CODE>
method, like this:</P>
<PRE>renderUI : function() {
    this.get('contentBox').append(this._makeNode());
},</PRE><P>
This will fill in the <CODE>contentBox</CODE> of our
widget with the markup resulting from processing the default
template. Method <CODE>_makeNode</CODE> returns an
instance of <CODE>Y.Node</CODE> which can be appended
or inserted anywhere or just held for later use. It does not return a
string, it already produces a <CODE>Node</CODE>
instance. 
</P>
<P>Method <CODE>_makeNode</CODE> takes two optional
arguments, a reference to a template and an object to fill in regular
placeholders, as <CODE>Y.substitute</CODE> does. In
our simple Spinner example there is a single template for the whole
widget but other widgets might require bits and pieces made out of
several templates. In that case, you would usually call <CODE>_makeNode</CODE>
with no arguments for the main part and call it once again with
different templates to fill in the extra parts. The <A HREF="http://satyam.com.ar/yui/3.0.0/SpinnerTest.html">example</A>
contains an otherwise useless component with this <CODE>renderUI</CODE>
method:</P>
<PRE>renderUI: function () {
    var fieldset = this._makeNode();
    this.each(function (item) {
        fieldset.appendChild(this._makeNode(MultipleTemplates.RADIO_TEMPLATE, item));
    }, this);
    this.get('contentBox').append(fieldset);
}</PRE><P>
The first call to <CODE>_makeNode</CODE>, using the
default template, returns a <CODE>Node</CODE> stored
in <CODE>fieldset</CODE>. The sample component is
also extended with <CODE>Y.ArrayList</CODE> so the
<CODE>RADIO_TEMPLATE</CODE> will be filled with
values taken from the items stored in the array list and the
resulting Nodes appended to the <CODE>fieldset</CODE>
before it is finally appended to the <CODE>contentBox</CODE>.
The special placeholders such as <CODE>{@} </CODE>or
<CODE>{p}</CODE> will still refer to attributes or
properties in the main object. The nested items will be processed
just as <CODE>Y.substitute </CODE>would. 
</P>
<H2>The _locateNodes method</H2>
<P>MakeNode further provides a <CODE>_locateNodes</CODE>
method which will try to locate all the elements with the classNames
declared in <CODE>_CLASS_NAMES</CODE>. To locate
specific elements you can pass any number of className keys,
otherwise, <CODE>_locateNodes</CODE> tries them all.
For each element found of each className, <CODE>_locateNodes</CODE>
will produce a private instance property using the underscore prefix
followed by the key name and the <CODE>"Node"</CODE>
suffix. Thus, in our Spinner example, <CODE>_locateNodes</CODE>
will generate the properties <CODE>_inputNode</CODE>,
<CODE>_upNode</CODE> and <CODE>_downNode</CODE>.
If several elements have the same className, <CODE>_locateNodes</CODE>
will return a reference to the first of them. If an element is not
found, no variable will be created.</P>
<P>In the Spinner component we use <CODE>_locateNodes</CODE>
after creating the markup:</P>
<PRE>renderUI : function() {
    this.get(CBX).append(this._makeNode());
    this._locateNodes();
},</PRE><H2>
The _EVENTS static property</H2>
<P>One further property can be defined along the <CODE>_TEMPLATE</CODE>
and <CODE>_CLASS_NAMES</CODE> and that is <CODE>_EVENTS</CODE>.
<CODE>_EVENTS</CODE> will contain a hash made up of
class name keys, each containing a hash of event types and methods to
handle them. It is better explained with an example:</P>
<PRE>_EVENTS: {
    '.': {
        key:{
            fn:'_onDirectionKey',
            args:((!Y.UA.opera) ? &quot;down:&quot; : &quot;press:&quot;) + &quot;38, 40, 33, 34&quot;
        },
        mousedown: '_onMouseDown'
    },
    '..': {
        mouseup: '_onDocMouseUp'
    },
    input: {
        change:'_onInputChange'
    }
},</PRE><P>
<CODE>_EVENTS</CODE> is an object (a hash) with any
number of properties. The names of the properties, that is, the keys
of the hash, identify the elements whose events we will listen to.
They are the same identifiers used in <CODE>_CLASS_NAMES</CODE>.
There are two extra special keys <CODE>&quot;.&quot;</CODE>
and <CODE>&quot;..&quot;</CODE>. While the className
keys refer to elements nested within the <CODE>contentBox</CODE>,
the <CODE>&quot;.&quot;</CODE> key refers to the
<CODE>boundingBox</CODE> itself while <CODE>&quot;..&quot;</CODE>
refers to the document containing this widget. Think of them as doing
a <CODE>chdir</CODE> command when located at the
<CODE>boundingBox</CODE> level. The <CODE>_EVENTS</CODE>
property is processed after the <CODE>renderUI</CODE>,
<CODE>bindUI</CODE> and <CODE>syncUI</CODE>
methods have been called so the widget is expected to be already
inserted within the document body, otherwise the <CODE>&quot;..&quot;</CODE>
will fail. 
</P>
<P>Each of the entries in <CODE>_EVENTS</CODE> is a
further object that uses the type of event as its key and the name of
an instance method to handle it. <CODE>_EVENTS</CODE>,
being a static variable, has no access to <CODE>this</CODE>
so it cannot take actual function reference, only the name of the
event listener method. Some event types need extra arguments, such as
the <CODE>key</CODE> event, in that case, instead of
providing the name of the event handler you can provide an object
with properties <CODE>fn</CODE> and <CODE>args</CODE>
to hold the function name and the extra arguments, when required. 
</P>
<P>MakeNode will use <CODE>Node.delegate</CODE> to
listen to the events of the nested elements, while it will use <CODE>Y.on</CODE>
to listen to events from the <CODE>boundingBox</CODE>
and the document body. (Note: listening to the <CODE>key</CODE>
event on any nested element works only with version 3.4.0pr1 and
above, since delegation of the <CODE>key</CODE> event
was not available before. All the other features work with previous
versions as well)</P>
<P>The <CODE>_EVENTS</CODE> declarations are
cumulative when components inherit from one another. Each class in
the inheritance chain will have its own <CODE>_EVENTS</CODE>
declaration processed separately.</P>
<H2>The _ATTRS_2_UI static property</H2>
<P>Events go both ways, from the UI to the component and from the
component to the UI. The first are handled by the <CODE>_EVENTS</CODE>
property. There are the events fired by changes in the value of the
configuration attributes that need to be reflected in the user
interface. As I mentioned in the previous article, when there are any
secondary effects from changing a configuration attribute, they
should be handled by <I>change</I> event listeners, not by the
optional <CODE>setter</CODE> method of the attribute,
which should only deal with normalizing the value being set. The UI
should reflect the state of the configuration attributes, first in
<CODE>syncUI</CODE>, when being initialized and then
on every attribute change event. For the latter, we need to attach an
event listener, which we do in <CODE>bindUI</CODE>.
Widget already provides a mechanism to make that simple, which I
described in the comments to the previous article. 
</P>
<P>Widget uses the instance property <CODE>_UI_ATTRS</CODE>
that contains an object with two further properties, <CODE>SYNC</CODE>
and <CODE>BIND</CODE>. Each of these is an array
listing the names of the configuration attributes to be initially
synched and then listened to in order to keep the UI reflecting their
values. Widget expects each of those entries to have a method
associated with it, named after the attribute name prefixed by <CODE>_uiSet</CODE>
with the first character of the attribute name converted to uppercase
to have the method name in proper camel case. Thus, if <CODE>&quot;value&quot;</CODE>
was listed in any of the <CODE>_UI_ATTRS</CODE>
arrays (in either <CODE>SYNC</CODE>
or <CODE>BIND</CODE>), Widget would expect to find a <CODE>_uiSetValue</CODE>
method. This method will receive two arguments, the <CODE>value</CODE>
being set and the <CODE>src</CODE> of the change.
This is the code for our Spinner <CODE>_uiSetValue</CODE>
method:</P>
<PRE>_uiSetValue : function(value, src) {
    if (src === UI) {
        return;
    }
    this._inputNode.set(VALUE, this.get(FORMATTER)(value));
},</PRE><P>
All the uppercase identifiers you see in this piece of code
correspond to string constants declared elsewhere, to allow the YUI
compressor to do its job better. The method, basically, sets the
<CODE>value</CODE> HTML attribute in the <CODE>&lt;input&gt;</CODE>
box to the new value set, after being formatted. The reference to the
textbox was provided by <CODE>_locateNodes</CODE>. The
<CODE>src</CODE> argument is initially checked to see
if set to the string value <CODE>'ui'</CODE>. If this
is so, no action will be taken. This is to avoid endless loops. If
the user enters something in the input box, its value would go into
the <CODE>value</CODE> configuration attribute which
then would fire a <CODE>valueChange</CODE> event,
which would get <CODE>_uiSetValue</CODE> called
which, if unchecked, would then go and change the value of the input
box, which would trigger the whole process again. Thus, in
<CODE>_uiSetValue</CODE>, if we know the change comes
from the UI, we do nothing and so break the loop. However, this
requires another piece of code elsewhere. In the listener for the DOM
event, when we set the configuration attribute, we use the third
optional argument to set, like this:</P>
<PRE>_afterValueChange : function(ev) {
    this.set(VALUE, ev.newVal, {src: UI});
}</PRE><P>
It is up to us to ensure that changes coming from the UI are flagged
thus and then check that same flag to avoid loops.</P>
<P>With all this said, I haven't yet mentioned the static property
<CODE>_ATTRS_2_UI</CODE> mentioned in the last heading. As the
comments in my previous article shows (through the blunders I made 
in them), making sure that all attributes affecting
the UI are properly listed is somewhat messy. You should never
initialize <CODE>_UI_ATTRS</CODE> from scratch since
Widget already lists a whole lot of attributes and those would be
lost. You have to concatenate new attribute names over the existing
ones, which is somewhat hard to remember how to do it right. 
To make it simple, MakeNode will read from the static
property <CODE>_ATTRS_2_UI</CODE> and do that
concatenation for you. It will concatenate all such lists from each
and every class in the inheritance chain so at each level each class
can handle its own attributes. In Spinner, we have:</P>
<PRE>_ATTRS_2_UI: {
    BIND: VALUE,
    SYNC: VALUE
},</PRE><P>
MakeNode will accept both an array of names or a single attribute
name, as in this case. 
</P>
<P>The question naturally arises, why two lists, one for binding the
other for synching? Quite often the <CODE>SYNC</CODE>
array has less entries than the <CODE>BIND</CODE>
list and this is because the template for the component might already
have the very same default value as the configuration attribute and
there is no need to do an initial synching. So, if the default value
for the <CODE>value</CODE> configuration attribute is
an empty string and the <CODE>&lt;input&gt;</CODE>
element in the template has no <CODE>value</CODE>
attribute, then there is no need to sync them on initialization.</P>
<p>MakeNode will check for duplicate entries in any of these arrays.  
If any appears, it means that a class our component inherits from 
already handles this attribute and any new declaration would most likely
overstep the <code>_uiSetXxxx</code> handler for it.
Incidentally, MakeNode also checks for duplicate entries in <code>_CLASS_NAMES</code>, 
which can also cause conflict in some, though not all, circumstances. 
MakeNode will write a message to the log for any such error.</p>
<H2>Conclusion</H2>
<P>MakeNode provides a very simple template processor, with simple
functionality but highly integrated with the Widget foundation class.
It also provides helper methods to create classNames to be used in
the template and use those names to locate the nodes created.  It
also provides the means to hook into the events generated both by the
UI and the component itself and associate each with a method.    It
does all these taking care of respecting all the inheritance chain
straight up from Widget and any level of classes you may define.  
</P>
<P>It does not provide for absolutely all possibilities, but covers a
good range of them, nevertheless, it does not preclude you from
adding that extra.  You might rarely have to write a <CODE>bindUI</CODE>
or <CODE>syncUI</CODE> method if you use the glue
provided by MakeNode, but you may do so, since MakeNode does not use
them.</P>
