<h1>Eva Duarte de Per&oacute;n, a.k.a. Evita</h1>

<p>Evita died four years before I was born and my family was
'anti-peronista' (against Per&oacute;n, who by then had turned a
tyrant). Actually, I was born about two weeks after the military
coup that kicked him out. Thus, it is a little difficult for me
to tell about Evita, since all I heard at home was bad.</p>

<p>Anyhow, Evita is very much loved by millions, and she was
(somewhat) fortunate to have died in the peak of their affection
to her. When she died (without being an elected official) her
embalmed body was placed in the Congress and millions of people
went by, day and night, for three days. The newsreels of the time
are amazing, I have never seen so many people in those places I
know so well. Now the city has doubled the population, and you
wouldn't be able to gather so many people for three continuous
days and nights.</p>

<p>History says that by 1943 the constitutional 'Radical'
government was in deep trouble. Radical in name only, since they
had been a party for half a century and you cannot keep being
radical for too long. As the recent and last Radical government
(the previous to Menem) they had grown overcomplacent with their
situation and were doing plain nothing, while the country was
falling apart. That is when we had our first military coup, a
tradition we've been keeping until recently. Several civilians or
military were placed by the Army on the high seat, but none knew
what to do. In the meantime, Per&oacute;n, an Army Colonel who had been
assigned to the Secretary of Public Welfare as well as Secretary
of State, started taking some very radical measures. It was much
like the New Deal and Per&oacute;n became as popular as FDR. Some group
within the army became jealous of Per&oacute;n's popularity so they
jailed him for some excuse or other. In the meantime, while he
had dismissed the military side, Per&oacute;n had been building his
network on the civilian side, with the Unions and politicians. On
October 17, Per&oacute;n was brought from the military base where he
was jailed, to the Army Hospital, here in Buenos Aires on some
silly excuse about a sore throat. Thousands of people gathered by
the Unions were already in Plaza de Mayo, while Per&oacute;n was being
'inadvertently' released from the Hospital and joined them. The
government had to call for elections and Per&oacute;n won by a
landslide early next year, 1946.</p>

<p>The war in Europe had just ended and there was a whole world
to feed, and Argentina had that food. There was also a huge
territory to populate, and Europe had refuges enough to do it. In
Per&oacute;n's own words (more or less) it was impossible to walk
through the aisles in the Central Bank since they were piled high
with gold. He made good use of that gold, and that brings us to
Evita. She headed the Fundaci&oacute;n Eva Per&oacute;n, which was funded
with government money, and it was a sort of parallel Ministry of
Welfare (the actual Minister did what she told him). A lot of
welfare benefits, funded with government money, were handed under
the name of the 'Fundaci&oacute;n' (still now, when you say 'La
Fundaci&oacute;n' it means that one). A law was passed enabling the
women to vote, so, for the 1952 election (which she couldn't
witness) she headed the campaign to get the female vote. She was
a very passionate orator, in a time when most politicians got
lost on rhetoric. She really talked to the people. Both
Per&oacute;n&#146;s dressed very simple. He often appeared in
shirtsleeves, thus the term 'descamisados' which means
un-shirted, though un-jacketed would have been more proper, since
the 'descamisados' were dressing shirts. Per&oacute;n and Evita often
talked from the balconies of the pink house (the presidential
palace) in a very simple way, very passionate and dressed just
like the people in the Plaza de Mayo, the square below.</p>

<p>All this welfare couldn't last. Even as much gold as Per&oacute;n
found in the aisles of the Central Bank, it couldn't last. His 6
year term ended in 1952 and he had reformed the constitution in
1949 to allow for his own re-election. He delayed the reforms
until after the re-election, (too late) while Evita went full
ahead doing her welfare thing, like distributing cider and sweet
bread for Christmas in the poorest neighborhoods, with full press
coverage, of course.</p>

<p>She died in the middle of that pre-electoral gift-giving
frenzy, and her death was turned part of the campaign. Of course,
Per&oacute;n won again, but the money had run out long ago and things
started getting tough. Evita's death really affected Per&oacute;n, and
so did the state of the economy, which didn't allow for his
'generosity'. His discourses started getting contradictory and
somewhat angry. The Plaza de Mayo started filling up less and
less, though the Unions forcibly got the workers on trucks to
fill up the square. By 1955, the coup that threw him out didn't
find a lot of resistance, no such thing as people building
barricades to defend him. Still, the decline of the country fell
upon the following government (which wasn't a good one anyway)
and people forgot that Per&oacute;n had actually caused it, so, they
remember the good times with him.</p>

<p>I think Evita was really true to what she did. She didn't have
a clue about economy (neither did Per&oacute;n) so none of them had the
slightest idea that money, even in a country as rich as
Argentina, would run out. They were both new rich kids and handed
out money without a second thought. They both came from very
humble families, and both knew hardship. Evita really worked hard
and even while her decease was consuming her, she kept on going.
Some say that Per&oacute;n poisoned her, because she was becoming more
popular than him. I don't think that would have been necessary.
Though women could vote, it was still unthinkable for a woman to
become President, there was no doubt Per&oacute;n would be reelected.
They could both walk the aisles of the Central Bank and see that
there was no gold left, only a huge debt. But they were both
drunk with power and I'm not sure Evita would have faced the
evidence: they were just out of money. Per&oacute;n hardly did
recognize it, and started finger pointing elsewhere, which didn't
fix anything and brought enemies from everywhere, like my family.
They were grocers and inflation started around that time. People
could see the prices rising and the visible face were my
grandparents. Per&oacute;n finger pointed to 'unscrupulous merchants'
in one of his discourses so, suddenly, my grandparents were 'the
enemy', though they had to pay ever increasing amounts of hard
cash to their suppliers, while most customers got their purchases
'wrote down' in the store notebook.</p>

<p>Evita's brother, Juan Duarte, was caught in some dirty
business some months after her death, he 'committed suicide'
shortly after. That fueled stories about her being poisoned, or
her being involved in dirty business. I don't think it was so.
Juan Duarte simply worked under the protection of his family
name. Nobody dared upset Evita, but if someone had told her,
perhaps she would have done more or less the same as Per&oacute;n did.
Once she was dead, the balance of power within the inner circle
had to be rearranged, and Juan lost.</p>

<p>So, I guess that is a most complete answer, ain't it? Anyway,
that's the story of a humble couple raised to a position of
power, with a lot of good intentions, going drunk with power
until they couldn't handle it anymore. She died while still at
the top. He was kicked out before the full weight of his
mismanagement was felt, so he was reelected once more in 1973 and
died a year after. His funeral, though impresive, wasn't as much
as Evita's.</p>
