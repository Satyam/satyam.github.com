            Notice that the sector wheels are not symmetrical. A gap can be seen
            right in the middle and two sets of teeth to each side. While the
            ones on the right are flush with the body of the wheel, the ones on
            the left are higher, almost three times as high. This allows the
            sector wheel to be partially engaged, that is, to remain engaged to
            one figure wheel and disengaged from the other.

      The animation above starts where the previous left off. The magenta sector
      wheel raises so that the teeth on the left side disengage the even figure
      wheel, at left on the background while the larger teeth on the right
      remain engaged. Then, the yellow sector wheel restore arms start to turn,
      eventually engaging the corresponding nibs protruding from the sector
      wheels. Notice that, once again, each sector wheel starts to move at a
      different time. If they held a 99, they would be engaged right away, but
      since they hold a 35, they are engaged past half way, the bottom one,
      holding the 5 two units before the upper one. While the sector wheels
      move, they carry along the figure wheels at right, effectively restoring
      them to their original values, while leaving alone the figure wheels to
      the left.
    </p>

      At the end of this sequence, the sector wheels raise to their topmost
      position, completely disengaging from both figure wheels and the yellow
      restore arm comes back to its resting position.
    </p>

    <p>
      The light blue arm is also rotating, but it is completely disengaged from
      the figure wheel, having been raised above the level of the inner teeth at
      the start of this sequence, and it is just going to its resting position,
      in preparation for the next cycle.

      Here is another view of the same sequence as above, from the other side
      and almost level with the upper figure wheel. The different size of the
      teeth on the bottom sector wheel is clearly visible. The gap in between
      the two sets of teeth can be seen at the bottom right of the image. The
      sequence starts with the sector wheel rising to a point where it still
      remains engaged to the left figure wheels and it ends when it is fully
      raised until disengaged completely, as can be appreciated in the upper
      sector wheel (due to the perspective, the bottom sector wheel seems to
      remain engaged, but it is not so).
