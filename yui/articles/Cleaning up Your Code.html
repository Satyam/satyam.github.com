<H2>Cleaning up Your Code</H2>
<P>Before asking the forums, there are plenty of things you can do by
yourself and, if you have your tools handy, you will find your answer
all by yourself in no time, without waiting for an answer that may
not come or, due to time zone differences, won't arrive before next
day. Besides, cleaner code is robust code, much less likely to break
in stress conditions. Good practices not only avoid fatal errors,
those that force you to post questions in the forums, but warnings
highlight minor errors and help you stay away from the fatal edge. 
</P>
<H3>JSLint</H3>
<P>A pass through <A HREF="http://www.jslint.com/">JSLint</A> is part
of the build process for YUI. JSLint, itself fully written in
JavaScript, is like a compiler but without code generation. It will,
though, produce all the error messages and warnings that a compiler
should and that the JavaScript interpreter forgives or assumes
defaults you might be unaware of. It is available in many formats
besides the web site, the YUI builder tool uses it as a standalone
command line application, you can integrate it into Eclipse or
whatever IDE or more-or-less capable editor you use and there is also
a Yahoo! Widget. 
</P>
<P>If the zillion lines of code in the YUI library can go through
JSLint with no errors and barely a warning (it can't avoid a few
things) so can your code. I find JSLint very helpful when I'm tired.
Bean counting in the late evening is a waste of time, you are likely
to miss the most obvious. JSLint doesn't care what time of the day it
is and will point you straight to that mismatched curly bracket or
misspelled variable that's getting you mad.</P>
<P>To make it helpful, you have to keep your code reasonably clean
from the start. If you've never used JSLint before and try it out on
an application which is already hundreds of lines long, it will flood
you with so many warnings that it will feel that in hampers your job
more than it helps. However, that only happens the first few times.
Once you learn to stay away from bad coding practices, JSLint
diagnostics will be very short and straight to the point, your real
error, the one that's driving you nuts, will clearly stand out. In
the meantime, JSLint will teach you to make your code safe and
robust.</P>
<P>So, don't wait for a tough error to show up. If you have never
used JSLint, try it with what you believe to be good code, it might
not be as good as you assumed. As the JSLint motto says, “JSLint
will hurt your feelings”, tough love indeed.</P>
<H3>Global and unused variables</H3>
<P>One of the things JSLint will warn you about are global variables.
There should be no global variables except those you know about, such
as the ones of the HTML DOM like window or document and those for the
libraries you are using such as <CODE>YAHOO</CODE> (in YUI2), <CODE>YUI</CODE>
(in YUI3) or your own namespace, if you created one.</P>
<P>Global variables are dangerous and there are already more than you
realize and extras such as mashups and banners might add more of
them. Since both the <CODE>window</CODE> and <CODE>document</CODE>
HTML DOM properties can be omitted, <CODE>window.name</CODE>,
<CODE>window.title</CODE> and <CODE>window.location</CODE> become
plain <CODE>name</CODE>, <CODE>title</CODE> and <CODE>location</CODE>.
Have you never used such variable names in your code? I don't mean in
their HTML DOM sense but as everyday field names in a database table
or such, like the title of a book, the name of its author and its
location in the shelfs. What if you use those variables without
declaring them? You might assume that name is initially undefined but
in fact, if you don't declare it (and initialize it) that might not
be so, since you would be accessing <CODE>window.name</CODE> without
being aware of it. And if you assign something to <CODE>location</CODE>,
you might navigate to nowhere in cyberspace. Here, I am just giving
examples of possible collisions with the browser's built-in
variables, but if you start adding libraries from other sources, the
number of collisions will increase. The JavaScript syntax highlighter
used in YUI's examples uses variable <CODE>dp</CODE> as its root and
the number of global variables any Google code might add when you
insert a map or other tool in your page is impolite, to say the
least.</P>
<P>It is not only that you don't want to step over other people's
variables, you don't want them to step on your yours. Or even you
stepping on your own. With asynchronous threads happening all the
time, you can't really be sure the order in which your various pieces
of code will execute and which one left what where.</P>
<P>Global variables might also point to a typo. If you have a global
variable you didn't mean to have and you have an unused variable with
a similar name, you might have misspelled either one: you declared it
with one name and used it with another different spelling. It can
also mean that you have declared it after you have used it, which
means that at execution time you might find your variable not
initialized as you would have expected.</P>
<H3><CODE>this</CODE></H3>
<P>Using <CODE>this</CODE> is often troublesome for beginners because
it is quite easy to lose track of where we are, that is, the scope.
Until we get some practice, keeping track of the scope we are in is
usually an issue. Any debugger will show you what <CODE>this</CODE>
points at. It is always a good thing to check first if <CODE>this</CODE>
points to where we expected. A lot of times when we have a bug it
will be because <CODE>this</CODE> is pointing to <CODE>window</CODE>.
There are several cases when this often happens:</P>
<P>If we have a method with an inner function, when we call that
function it won't get the scope of the caller but <CODE>window</CODE>.
This example shows that the inner function does not share the scope
of the method it is contained within:</P>
<PRE>var someObject = {
    outerFunction: function () {
        console.log('outer',this); // prints outer Object {}
        var innerFunction = function () {
            console.log('inner',this);<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><B>// prints inner Window</B></FONT>
        };
        innerFunction();
    }
};
someObject.outerFunction();</PRE><P>
There are a couple of ways to fix this. In this example, we ask
JavaScript to correct the scope in the function call</P>
<PRE>var someObject = {
    outerFunction: function () {
        console.log('outer',this); // prints outer Object {}
        var innerFunction = function () {
            console.log('inner',this); // prints inner Object {}
        };
        innerFunction<FONT COLOR="#33cc66"><B>.call(this)</B></FONT>;
    }
};
someObject.outerFunction();</PRE><P>
Here we take advantage of the ability for inner functions to share
the variables of containing functions. We create a variable <CODE>self</CODE>
which we initialize to the value of <CODE>this</CODE> at that point,
thus freezing it and we use that one:</P>
<PRE>var someObject = {
    outerFunction: function () {
        console.log('outer',this); // prints outer Object {}
        <FONT COLOR="#33cc66"><B>var self = this;</B></FONT>
        var innerFunction = function () {
            console.log('inner',<FONT COLOR="#33cc66"><B>self</B></FONT>); // prints inner Object {}
        };
        innerFunction();
    }
};
someObject.outerFunction();   </PRE><P>
Finally, with events, the scope of the listener is that of the
element we are listening for:</P>
<PRE>var someObject = {
    outerFunction: function () {
        console.log('outer',this); // prints outer Object {}
        YAHOO.util.Event.on('button','click',function () {
            console.log('inner',this); <FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><B>// prints inner &lt;button id=&quot;button&quot;&gt;</B></FONT>
        });
    }
};
someObject.outerFunction();</PRE><P>
Unless we adjust the scope of the listener when setting it up 
</P>
<PRE>var someObject = {
    outerFunction: function () {
        console.log('outer',this); // prints outer Object {}
        YAHOO.util.Event.on('button','click',function () {
            console.log('inner',this); // prints inner Object {}
        }<FONT COLOR="#33cc66"><B>,this,true</B></FONT>);
    }
};
someObject.outerFunction();</PRE><P>
This also applies to YUI components: if we listen to a click event on
a DataTable cell, a TreeView node or MenuItem, their scope of the
listeners will be those of the YUI component instance that owns the
event you subscribe to, unless it is explicitly set otherwise.</P>
<H3>Sandboxes for applications</H3>
<P>A good way to keep your code clean is to start with a clean
skeleton. The style of coding JavaScript applications have changed
over time, nowadays most of us have settled into two different
styles, one for applications and one for library components. Most
YUI2 examples reflect the old style, where we used <CODE>YAHOO.namespace</CODE>
method to create a namespace for our own code or used <CODE>YAHOO.example</CODE>,
which is predefined and unused. There has also been some influence
from Java where everything must be an object. We were still to find
our own ground in JavaScript coding and whole spectrum of alternative
ways were used over time. 
</P>
<P>Nowadays, for end applications, we mostly use a single sandbox
declared like this:</P>
<PRE>YAHOO.util.Event.onDOMReady(function() {
    var Dom = YAHOO.util.Dom,
        Event = YAHOO.util.Event,
        Lang = YAHOO.lang;

    var yourVariable = initialValue,
        moreOfTheSame = otherInitialValue;
    
    var myFunction1 = function ( …) {
        // body of function;
    };
    var myFunction2 = function (… ) {
        // body of function;
    };
    ...
});</PRE><P>
This technique has several benefits. 
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We check for the readiness of the
	DOM right from the start, ensuring that all the pieces of HTML that
	we might want to manipulate are there.

	</OL>
	<LI><P>We define our functions. We can do this with the <CODE>var</CODE>
	statement, as I did above or the <CODE>function</CODE> statement;
	there is a subtle difference but it is mostly irrelevant. I use the
	<CODE>var</CODE> statement to highlight that they are just as
	accessible as the other variables: we can access them anywhere in
	the sandbox. 
	</P>
</OL>
<P>Of course this relies on the ability of JavaScript to allow us to
define functions within functions and that the inner functions have
access to all the variables defined inside the function, in any of
the functions it is contained in or at the global level. Basically,
each function you define creates a new local environment accessible
to any further functions within.</P>
<P>This is the standard way of doing things in YUI3:</P>
<PRE>YUI().use('module1', … , function (Y) {
    // This is the sandbox
}) ;</PRE><H3>
Namespaces for libraries</H3>
<P>While the sandboxing technique is great for final applications, it
is not good for libraries. What happens in the sandbox stays in the
sandbox, completely invisible to the outside world but if you define
a library utility or component of your own, you want to re-use it so
it needs to be accessible from anywhere, i.e., to be globally
accessible, which is not exactly the same as being global. Anything
you define under <CODE>YAHOO.example</CODE>, for example,
<CODE>YAHOO.example.myUtility</CODE> is globally accessible, you can
access it by its full name from anywhere after it has been defined.
<CODE>myUtility</CODE>, however, is not global, <CODE>YAHOO</CODE> is
global and that is the root of a large tree of branches, some taken
by the YUI (<CODE>widget</CODE>, <CODE>util</CODE>, <CODE>lang</CODE>),
some available for anyone to use (<CODE>example</CODE>) and others
you may define using <CODE>YAHOO.namespace</CODE>.</P>
<P>When you build libraries, you usually use both the sandbox for
your code and namespacing for sharing, like this:</P>
<PRE>(function () {
    var MyClass = function () {
        // this would be the constructor
    };
    MyClass.prototype = {
        // properties and methods 
    };
    YAHOO.namespace('MyLibrary');
    YAHOO.MyLibrary.MyClass = MyClass
})();</PRE><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
We create a sandbox by defining everything within an anonymous
function, which we immediately execute. Within it, we have the same
advantages as with the previous sandbox, we can define short names
for anything we use often, even for the class we are defining, none
of them will be visible outside. Then, to make it globally
accessible, we create a namespace of our own and place our recently
created class in it. 
</P>
<H3>YUI Logger</H3>
<P>We have our code nice and clean, we JSLinted it and still have
errors. YUI can be quite helpful in telling us what is wrong. For
production code, we will usually load the minified versions of the
YUI components but there are also two other versions. The <TT>-debug.js</TT>
version is the one that can help us find out what is wrong. For
example, we might be using Dom's method <CODE>setStyle</CODE> to,
lets say, change the color of a block of text. The change doesn't
happen and we can't find what's wrong. The file <TT>dom-debug.js</TT>
has this helpful line:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">YAHOO.log('element ' + el + ' is undefined', 'error', 'Dom');</PRE><P>
This is executed when <CODE>setStyle</CODE> tries to locate the
element to be styled and does not find it. The error message will
probably show misspelled element id or some such error that is so
hard to pick after a long day. 
</P>
<P>It is quite easy to get the logger up and running, you just need
to include its files:</P>
<PRE>&lt;link type=&quot;text/css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.8.1/build/logger/assets/skins/sam/logger.css&quot;&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.8.1/build/yahoo-dom-event/yahoo-dom-event.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.8.1/build/dragdrop/dragdrop-min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.8.1/build/logger/logger-min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</PRE><P>
The basic yahoo-dom-event aggregate is most likely to be there
already, the Drag &amp; Drop quite handy to move the logger window
out of the way. Then, you just add:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">var myLogReader = new YAHOO.widget.LogReader();</PRE><P>
In fact, you don't really need to save a reference to the reader
instance, since there isn't much you are likely to do with it. Then,
it is a matter of loading the -debug versions of the component files
and all the messages they produce will be start being shown. The
amount of information can be overwhelming so, it is wise not to load
all debug versions at once. The Logger can also filter the
information it displays and you may uncheck the Info category of
messages to concentrate on Warn and Fail. The filters do not affect
what is logged, only what is shown, Logger logs all messages,
regardless of whether the LogReader displays them or not. There is
only one message queue for application and logging will start as soon
as the Logger component file is loaded, it doesn't matter whether it
is shown or not. 
</P>
<P>Really, the only tedious thing about the Logger is to change the
component files from the minified, aggregates and combos to the
-debug versions.  In this, as always, the <A HREF="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/hosting/">Dependency
Configurator</A> is a great help, click on the -debug button on the
top left and it will produce the correct list of files.   Now that
I've mentioned it:</P>
<H3>Check your dependencies</H3>
<P>It is usually a good idea when you start with YUI to pick an
example that closely resembles what you want to do and modify it.  As
you add more and more features, you take bits and pieces from other
examples and paste them into your developing application.  One
frequent source of problems are the dependencies.  Many people paste
the dependency files of each and every example into their
application, duplicating some of them over and over again.  Missing,
duplicate or out of order dependencies might produce unexpected
errors.  Not having the YAHOO Global Object loaded before anything
else is most certainly going to be fatal.  At any rate, loading
something twice will certainly increase the time it takes your page
to load.  
</P>
<P>Finally, if you are using your own servers to load the YUI library
from, you might have the base path for your copy of the library
wrong.  If you have Firebug, go to the Net tab and check that there
are no lines in red.  That means some resource could not be found.</P>
<H3>Debugging</H3>
<P>The Firebug add-on for Firefox is still the best debugger around,
and it is free.  By default, when the debugger is activated the
“Break on all errors” option is on, which means that Firebug will
stop at the point where it finds an error and show the error message
and source code.   Some of those errors will be the same that JSLint
would have diagnosed so JSLint is still the first place to start
with, specially since Firebug can only signal one error on each run
while JSLint will signal them all at once so you can fix them all in
one go.  Some errors will only show up at runtime so the debugger is
the only option.  Whenever you get to such a break, the first thing
to check is <CODE>this</CODE>, a four-letter word of the worst sort.</P>
<P>When using a sandbox, debuggers will usually show local variables
and arguments, but they will normally not offer to show the variables
in containing functions, such as those declared in the sandbox and
used from within the inner functions.   The debugger will be able to
show their value if you explicitly ask for them by name, but it will
not show them automatically.  Another alternative is to make them
globally accessible.  For example, since <CODE>YAHOO.example</CODE>
is always available, if you want to keep an eye on a certain
component at all times, you can simply copy it there:</P>
<PRE>var myTree = new YAHOO.widget.TreeView('tree-container');
YAHOO.example.myTree = myTree;</PRE><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
We add the last assignment while debugging so we can keep an eye on
the TreeView instance while debugging since <CODE>myTree</CODE> would
normally be within the sandbox and invisible elsewhere.</P>
<H3>Stack Traces</H3>
<P>The YUI library is robust and very reliable.  If the debugger
breaks within the YUI library, it is more likely that it is because
of an error induced by your code that by some failure in YUI itself. 
JavaScript was designed to carry on always coping with errors as best
as possible.  The YUI library does likewise.  The -debug versions
will have extra checks and will emit diagnostic messages, but they
are all stripped out in the minified versions.  If you see an error
in a YUI file it is likely that it got there out of pure
stubbornness, but don't try to find the error there.  When the
debugger stops it is not because it has found the cause of the error
but because the JavaScript interpreter can no longer carry on.  
</P>
<P>Breaks in minified files are not helpful, if you get a message
such as 
</P>
<PRE>F is not an object in line 7 of dom-min.js</PRE><P>
it is pointless to ask in the forum about it.  First of all, F is an
alias generated by YUI Compressor to replace a longer variable name
in the original uncompressed file, second, the first few lines are
usually taken by the copyright notice, which the YUI Compressor
always respects.  And since the YUI Compressor also deletes all new
lines, as it does with other white space, all the executable code in
dom-min.js is in lines 7, 8 and 9 so the line number doesn't say much
either.</P>
<P>That is when the Stack trace tab in the right subpanel of the
Script tab of Firebug (or wherever you can find the stack trace in
your debugger) comes handy.  It tells you how you got there. 
Usually, the item on top is the current statement, the one below is
the place where the current function was called, the one below that
the function that called the previous one and so on.  Most debuggers
will let you select any of those trace points and see how you got to
where you are.  Firebug, for one, also lets you check the value of
the variables at each of the trace points.  
</P>
<P>You might not recognize many of the names in the stack trace, they
might be functions within functions within the YUI library itself. 
Looking into that stack trace you will see compressed code, simply
ignore it, there is not much anyone can do with it, go to the next
level until you find something you can read.   Go to those names you
recognize that belong to your own code or, if none found, Firebug
uses <CODE>(?)()</CODE> for traces it cannot give a name.  Usually,
your code in the sandbox will be signaled that way.  At any such
point in your trace, check the values of the variables you provided
as arguments, some of them might not be what you assumed.  Check them
against the API docs to see if it is a valid argument value.  
</P>
<P>If the argument and variable values you see are inconclusive, at
least you can place a breakpoint right before your code calls the YUI
component.  You might then be able to see how you got into the mess.</P>
<P>Stack traces are often ignored but with JavaScript's tendency to
keep digging itself into an ever deeper hole as it tries to carry on,
it is good to be able to come up to the surface.</P>
<H3>Breakpoints asynchronous callbacks</H3>
<P>Sometimes there is no alternative but to step through the code.
