			<h3><a name="book"></a>YUI 2.8: Learning the Library</h3>
			<p>My first published book.  Something I didn't expect.  The guys at Packt Books sent me an email around December 2009 asking if I cared
			to do an update to their existing book on YUI.  The original author was busy at the time and could not do it.  My first question was if
			they weren't a little late.  More and more of YUI3 was coming out of beta at the time, why YUI2?  Anyway, I had the time and the knowledge
			and they were willing to pay a modest advance so they were serious about it, so I did it. It wasn't such a bad idea after all, YUI3 added the ability 
			to load YUI2 components into its sandbox, which means YUI2 widgets have a long way to go.</p>
			<p>It gave me a big oportunity to really learn the whole library, not just the components I am most used to.  It also allowed me to work with
			very nice people whom I never met face to face and, funny enough, for a book published in English, many of them weren't native English speakers, 
			starting with me.</p>
			<p>Anyway, it is finally out there: <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/yahoo-user-interface-yui-2-8-learning-library/book">YUI 2.8: Learning the Library</a>

            <h3>
              Server driven DataTable with pagination and sorting.
            </h3>
            <p>
              This example builds a DataTable based on the columns information
              taken from the server. Instead of building a statically defined
              DataTable it will build it based on what the server says.
            </p>
            <p>
              It has been based on the <a href=
              "http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/datatable/dt_serverpagination.html">
              server-side pagination</a> and <a href=
              "http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/datatable/dt_serversorting.html">
              server-side sorting</a> examples. They have both been changed in
              that they do not use the DataSource to communicate with the
              server but use a plain Connection Manager request to fetch the
              information and then pass it as a local source to the DataSource.
              This allows full access to all the information received from the
              server before it gets sent to the DataTable. Reported bugs on
              both examples have been fixed as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              The source files for this sample are available for download in a
              <a href="dt_server_driven.zip">zip file</a>. The PHP server
              script requires an active PHP interpreter. The YUI compoments are
              fetched from the YUI site.

			<!--h4><img src="new.png"/> New for 2.5.1</h4>
			<p>The examples have been completely redone for this release.  
			Server-side paging has been fully revamped.  
			All the extra code required to do server-side paging around
			the DataTable is now completely gone since most is handled
			directly from within the DataTable.
			Now it only requires a few settings, some function overrides and little more.</p>
            <p>The most noticeable change for the user is the page links, which are now
			provided by the DataTable itself, with the same features as for 
			client-side paging and can be customized just as well.</p>
            <p>Server-side sorting, though, is not really well integrated
			into the DataTable yet so that part is not so clean.</p>

            <h3>
              Data Grid
            </h3>
            <p>
              The DataTable is basically meant to represent data structured as
              in a regular database table. As such, it has a definition for
              each of the columns which applies to all rows in the table.
              Unless the designer provides customized code, every cell in the
              same column will behave the same.
            </p>
            <p>
              This example uses an extra invisible column to provide data type
              definitions for each individual cell so that instead of a single
              definition applicable to all the cells in a column, each cell has
              its own definition. For the purpose of the example, this
              definition is only a string indicating whether the cell contains
              a number, text or date, nevertheless, in a real case there is no
              reason why it cannot be a complex object describing several
              attributes.
            </p>
            <p>
              All columns have a custom formatter and editor function. These do
              not actually do any formatting or editing but they check the
              corresponding data type information stored in the extra column
              paired to the one being actually formatted or edited and then
              calls the standard formatters and editors provided for along the
              DataTable component
            </p>
            <p>
              The example is fully contained in the HTML file, its only
              external resources are the YUI component files which are
              downloaded from the YUI download site.

			<p>No changes where required for this version</p>
			<h4><img src="new.png"/> New for 2.6.0</h4>
			<p>Editors are now separate classes and their interface to the DataTable has changed
			so the example had to be redone to handle this separate editor classes. 
			A pool of an assortment of already instanced editors is placed in an object and used as requested</p>

              DataTable with extra details in tabbed pop-up
            </h3>
            <p>
              This example draws a very basic DataTable and on clicking on any cell, 
			  a YUI Panel will pop-up containing a YUI TabView with four tabs.  
			  Each tab has a child DataTable with different contents, 
			  all related to the clicked record. 
			  The contents in the cells of these child tables is generated dynamically
			  and it reflects the base table row number and tab numbers active plus the row
			  and column position of the cell.
            </p>
			<p>In order to make the example totally self-contained, the data on all the tables
			is created locally.  In an actual application the data would come from data servers.
			Besides changing the columns and field definitions to match the actual data,
			to make this example work
			in client-server environments the single argument to the constructors of all the new DataSources
			would need to be changed to the URL of the servers providing the data.</p>
			<h4><img src="new.png"/> New for 2.5.1</h4>
			<p>This example uses method 
			<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/docs/YAHOO.util.DataSource.html#sendRequest"><code>sendRequest</code></a>
			of the DataSource to retrieve new data for the child tables.  It has been modified to accept the arguments in the new format.
			The new version has provided backward-compatibility so it would have worked just the same the way it was.</p>

              Invoice: drag and drop, summary row and field validation
            </h3>
            <p>
              This example allows you to do an invoice by dragging items out of a DataTable with 
			  a list of items into another DataTable.  It has in-line cell editing with an editor with
			  a regular expression validator.  The invoice uses the TFOOT element of the table
			  to do the totals
            </p>
			<h4><img src="new.png"/> New for 2.5.1</h4>
			<p>There are only two changes for this version.  
			Method <code>getTableEl</code> does not exist anymore so it has been replaced by a way around.  
			Also, the inline style definition for className number had to be replaced due to the new
			'liner' element in between the HTML cell and the actual content.</p>
			<p>Since now the headers are a separate table from the body of the DataTable
			the column widths are now calculated by the DataTable on each refresh. 
			The footer is not included in this calculation since the DataTable ignores
			it exists. When first loaded, the right-hand table is empty and the footer
			with the totals does not match the headers 
			(the titles in grey to the left don't end where they should). 
			As soon as an item is dropped into the invoice, the borders align fine.</p>
			<p><img src="new.png"/> <img src="new.png"/> Fixed: <strike>Also, if you enter a large quantity on any of the items so that the totals
			grow wide, the headers and the table won't match any longer.
			Finally, there must be some padding or margin in the 'liner' element so that
			the totals are not aligned with the item prices. This I should be able to fix ASAP.</strike>
			The overflowing totals with large quantities was fixed by calling method <code>_syncColWidths</code>
			after the values are recalculated.  Though the DataTable does not know about the tfoot element,
			the tbody of the table does adjust its width to it so <code>_syncColWidths</code> is able to adjust 
			the headers to it.  This was a tip by Jenny Han Donnelly, thanks.  
			I often discourage the use of private methods and properties (those signaled by a leading underscore)
			since they are unsupported.  In this case, tfoot elements are also unsupported so this whole example
			may break at any moment.
			Also, the alignment issue was solved by adding the same padding to the extra cells 
			as the liner element has in the body of the table.</p>
			<h4><img src="new.png"/> New for 2.6.0</h4>
			<p>The example was updated to use the new cell editors.</p>
			<p>One of the purposes of this example was to show how to create your own cell editor.  
			Since the whole way the cell editors work has changed, my sample text editor has changed as well.
			I also used the cell editor to edit a cell which is not actually part of the editor.  
			Once again, that has been changed to use the new-style cell editors.</p>

             Here, the DataTable is extended with a function <code>deleteRowsBy</code> analogous to 
			 function <code>getChildrenBy</code> in YAHOO.util.Dom, where you provide a function
			 that will return a Boolean indicating whether the record is to be deleted or not.  
			 This function receives an object with all the values of each record to decide.

              TreeView with DataTables as leafs
            </h3>
            <p>
             The example builds a couple of random trees.  It will show a DataTable at the end of each branch.</p>
			 
			 <p>In the first tree, several branches can be open at the same time so it builds a DataTable for each.</p>
			 
			 <p>In the second tree, only one branch will be open at a time so it uses just one DataTable for all of them 
			 and just moves it around.
			 It also uses a single DataSource with caching enabled so that if a node is visited again
			 the data can be read from the cache.
            </p>
			<h4><img src="new.png"/> New for 2.6.0</h4>
			<p>I learned to use the TreeView much better so I changed my initial use of TextNodes to HTMLNodes
			which provide a much more natural generic container for the table. Since 2.6 provides keyboard
			navigation, I also made the example respond to the Enter key as well as clicks. 
			Finally, I just cleaned it up a bit, providing more standard shortcut names and reordering things around.</p>

			<a name="tooltips"></a>
			<h3>Showing Tooltips over the DataTable</h3>
			<p>The example shows how you can show ToolTips over DataTable cells.  
			It uses just one ToolTip for the whole of the DataTable	which is filled and positioned each time.  
			It uses events cellMouseoverEvent and cellMouseoutEvent to detect when the cursor is over the table cells we care about.  
			A couple of timers handle the delay until the tooltip is shown and how long it shows.
			The text for the tooltip is taken from an extra field in the table which is not shown.</p>

			<p>A custom method added to the DataTable to allow for easy refreshing of the DataTable with new data.</p>
			<h4><img src="new.png"/> New for 2.8.0</h4>
			<p>I improved the requery method to support client and server-side paging and sorting, with some limitations.
			It is not a universal solution, some of the functionality will require support of the server or added code
			on the client.  Please do read the notes, don't just copy the code and expect it to work because it might not
			work in all circumstances.</p>

			<p>The TreeView control now supports highlighting of nodes.  
			The visual element showing the highlight can be checkboxes, as in the TaskNode example.
			However, this facility is now supported in all node types, including TextNodes.</p>

			<h3>Building trees from HTML markup or from previous definitions</h3>
			<p>The TreeView control can read existing markup, 
			can build a tree from the definition of an existing TreeView

			This example shows some extra features of these capabilities.</p>

			<a  name="YQLDataSource"></a>
			<h3>YQL DataSource</h3>
			<p><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/">YQL</a> (YAHOO! Query Language) provides a 
			simple mechanism to access information stored in YAHOO servers from all its services, 
			not only its search engine but Flickr, contacts, weather, places and such. 
			To use that information from YUI widgets such as DataTable, Charts or AutoComplete
			you need to use a <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/docs/YAHOO.util.ScriptNodeDataSource.html">ScriptNodeDataSource</a>.  
			Since most of the settings for it would be
			fixed when using YQL and others can be deduced from the query results, it makes sense
			to subclass ScriptNodeDataSource to handle as many defaults as possible.</p>
			<p>The example code contains the definition of YQLDataSource and a simple example
			of how to use it on a DataTable.  The idea came via this <a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2009/06/17/yui-and-yql/">article</a>
			on the YUI Blog	</p>

			<h3>Key Navigation in DataTable cell editor</h3>
			<p>Surrendering to <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-javascript/message/51964">popular demand</a>, once again.  
			Many people asked to navigate in between cell editors by using the TAB key, so I gave it a try.  I threw in arrow keys as well.
			It works a little funny when getting to the edges and doesn't pop up all editors, don't know why.</p>
			<p>Suggestions welcome</p>
			<p><img src="new.png"/>Matt Parker has improved on this idea by adding a method <code>allowMoveCellWhileEdit</code> to
			the cell editors that tell whether a particular keystroke should allow moving to other cell editor. In my example,
			I allowed it for all editors but Textareas.  Matt's code allows a far better control on what is allowed for each cell editor.
			It is all in one package with his Column Chooser, which can be enabled separately.</p>

			Working with the YUI DataTable Control
            </h3>
			<p>After using the DataTable for a while and answering questions from fellow users 
			about it I realized I could help a little bit by putting together all I had learned in the process
			so I wrote a big article which Eric Miraglia very kindly refused, and right he was on doing so!
			After clearing up my ideas I realized there were about four separate articles that could
			be written.  The first two were then accepted for publication by Eric at the YUI blog site
			after some editing which he very kindly handled.</p>

              A PHP back end to YUI
            </h3>
			<p>Some of the material in the article I originally prepared for publication at
			the YUI blog had no JavaScript at all, it was pure PHP so here it is with 
			some extra PHP thrown in.
			</p>
			<p>This article contains the code that would be the back-end to the code in the other
			two articles or, for that matter, in any AJAX application or, perhaps, it should be
			AJAJ since it uses JSON and not XML.
			</p>
			<p>It also contains the code for my BuildSql function which is a sort of sprintf
			oriented towards SQL so that you write your SQL statement with placeholders and then
			the function takes care of inserting the rest of the arguments into the template with 
			the proper format, quoting and escaping.

            <h3>
             Making your own DataTable
            </h3>
			<p>YUI's DataTable component has many options so that it can be used in all
sorts of applications and environments. Any single user, though, uses just a few of them. It is a
good idea to encapsulate those few options in a single place so that even if at
some point you decide to make a change, it will be propagated to all places at
once.</p>
<p>Whatever options the server provides will probably determine how we communicate with it. 
The nature of our application will define the types of data we handle.  
The looks and behavior of our site will fix some more options.
Finally, we may desperately need some patch and can't wait for the next release.
These are options that we may cast into our own DataTable, inherited from YUI DataTable</p>
<h4><img src="new.png"/> New for 2.6.0</h4>
<p>Most of this article became obsolete with later versions of the DataTable.  Many of the features I showed here are now part of the DataTable, 
others have to be done in different ways. The <a href="#DataTable-2.6">example</a> for the new articles for the DataTable in the <a href="#yuiblog">YUI blog</a> now cover
mostly all this article has so if you are using 2.6, this is not for you.</p>

				  <h3>Building Your Own Widget Library with YUI</h3>
				  <p>At one point, the YUI discussion forum got several messages about people developing their own widgets.  
				  The YUI blog also reported a few.  All of them failed to conform to the current YUI standards, with good reason,
				  those <i>standards</i> are not available anywhere.</p>
				  
				  <p>There is a good reason for that, the YUI library has been continuously growing and perfecting itself,
				  but nobody had time to get all that experience gained by the YUI team anywhere.  
				  Moreover, the YUI library itself is not a good means of learning those standards since many of the components
				  follow different conventions.  Adapting those components to the ever improving standards would have meant making
				  them incompatible with earlier versions.  This means that each component is frozen at its historical moment, and 
				  if you don't know the history of the library, you don't know why each one is as it is.</p>
				  
				  <p>So, in the end, I went to the newest components and started learning from them and compiled a list of guidelines
				  which I later put together into this article.  Eric Miraglia was very kind to check that I wasn't saying anything stupid 
				  (both in my use of English and in describing the library) and also asked me to explore some features I had overlooked.</p>
