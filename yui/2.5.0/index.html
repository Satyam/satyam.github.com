              This example builds a DataTable based on the columns information
              taken from the server. Instead of building a statically defined
              DataTable it will build it based on what the server says.
            </p>
            <p>
              It has been based on the <a href=
              "http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/datatable/dt_serverpagination.html">
              server-side pagination</a> and <a href=
              "http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/datatable/dt_serversorting.html">
              server-side sorting</a> examples. They have both been changed in
              that they do not use the DataSource to communicate with the
              server but use a plain Connection Manager request to fetch the
              information and then pass it as a local source to the DataSource.
              This allows full access to all the information received from the
              server before it gets sent to the DataTable. Reported bugs on
              both examples have been fixed as well.

              The source files for this sample are available for download in a

              script requires an active PHP interpreter. The YUI compoments are
              fetched from the YUI site.

              Data Grid
            </h3>
            <p>
              The DataTable is basically meant to represent data structured as
              in a regular database table. As such, it has a definition for
              each of the columns which applies to all rows in the table.
              Unless the designer provides customized code, every cell in the
              same column will behave the same.
            </p>
            <p>
              This example uses an extra invisible column to provide data type
              definitions for each individual cell so that instead of a single
              definition applicable to all the cells in a column, each cell has
              its own definition. For the purpose of the example, this
              definition is only a string indicating whether the cell contains
              a number, text or date, nevertheless, in a real case there is no
              reason why it cannot be a complex object describing several
              attributes.
            </p>
            <p>
              All columns have a custom formatter and editor function. These do
              not actually do any formatting or editing but they check the
              corresponding data type information stored in the extra column
              paired to the one being actually formatted or edited and then
              calls the standard formatters and editors provided for along the
              DataTable component
            </p>
            <p>
              The example is fully contained in the HTML file, its only
              external resources are the YUI component files which are
              downloaded from the YUI download site.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>

              DataTable with extra details in tabbed pop-up
            </h3>
            <p>
              This example draws a very basic DataTable and on clicking on any cell, 
			  a YUI Panel will pop-up containing a YUI TabView with four tabs.  
			  Each tab has a child DataTable with different contents, 
			  all related to the clicked record. 
			  The contents in the cells of these child tables is generated dynamically
			  and it reflects the base table row number and tab numbers active plus the row
			  and column position of the cell.
            </p>
			<p>In order to make the example totally self-contained, the data on all the tables
			is created locally.  In an actual application the data would come from data servers.
			Besides changing the columns and field definitions to match the actual data,
			to make this example work
			in client-server environments the single argument to the constructors of all the new DataSources
			would need to be changed to the URL of the servers providing the data.</p>

              This example allows you to do an invoice by dragging items out of a DataTable with 
			  a list of items into another DataTable.  It has in-line cell editing with an editor with

			<p>YUI's DataTable component has many options so that it can be used in all
sorts of applications and environments. Any single user, though, uses just a few of them. It is a
good idea to encapsulate those few options in a single place so that even if at
some point you decide to make a change, it will be propagated to all places at
once.</p>
<p>Whatever options the server provides will probably determine how we communicate with it. 
The nature of our application will define the types of data we handle.  
The looks and behavior of our site will fix some more options.
Finally, we may desperately need some patch and can't wait for the next release.
These are options that we may cast into our own DataTable, inherited from YUI DataTable</p>
